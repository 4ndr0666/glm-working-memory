# Paper-2 v1.7 — Boundary Registrations, Task-71 (trace 1a181456f4ee82d9)

**Date:** 2026-10-28 (UTC) · **Witness:** GLM (Z.ai), designation Witness
**Base:** GWM `4c17765` (Task-70 confirmed landed on origin — pulled this
boundary). **MEDA:** `8f7e21a` applied operator-side, push pending (§1).
**Deposit state:** draft-3.1 (`9b326af7…`) byte-frozen; G0-asserted twice this
boundary (before and after conversion).

## 1. Task-70 MEDA delivery HALT — adjudicated: ALREADY-APPLIED, not a hijack

Operator paste (AS-PRESENTED): `gwm-task70-meda-delivery.sh` halted at
`[2/9] anti-hijack lower pin` — `HEAD=8f7e21aa…`, expected `BASE=bbe4c00e…`.

Witness-side facts, each verified before ruling:

1. `8f7e21a` **is the bundle's own EXPECT head** (Task-70 record: "expect
   APPLIED @ 8f7e21aa06bc8b321b40538756421f59e43a6bb0").
2. `parent(8f7e21a) == bbe4c00` (verified in the witness clone) — the exact
   fast-forward path the bundle delivers. Hash equality is content equality:
   the operator's tree contains the polish commit itself, not a lookalike.
3. GitHub `4NDR0MEDA` origin/main is **still at `bbe4c00`** (witness fetch
   this boundary) — the `[9/9]` push never landed.

**Ruling:** the anti-hijack lower pin did exactly its job — it refused a
second apply onto a tree that already contains the delivery. The tree did not
move to a foreign commit; it moved to precisely the expected head. This is
the **already-applied idempotency case**, not divergence and not a hijack.
Reconstruction: a prior apply (script leg `[6]`, or a manual ff from the
bundle) succeeded; the push never completed; the re-run halted at `[2/9]` by
design. Fail-visible, never fail-stopped: the operator pasted the refusal
back per protocol, and the leg closes below.

**D-class harness registration:** the 9-leg delivery scripts lack an
already-applied branch — after a successful apply, a re-run HALTs at `[2]`
instead of recognizing `HEAD == EXPECT`. Fix adopted for all future delivery
scripts: check `HEAD == EXPECT` **first**, then enter verify-only mode
(liveness legs + push). The companion script below implements exactly that
for this leg and closes it.

**Closure path (operator, one command):**

```
bash gwm-task70-meda-verify-push.sh          # staged in gwm-inbox + task70-meda-kit
```

Legs: `[1]` repo locate → `[2]` `HEAD == 8f7e21a` (the new entry pin) →
`[3]` liveness markers (A1 snapshot `23a9615a…` ×1 in PIN-CHAIN.md, polish
notes entry, LICENSE, CI workflow) → `[4]` manifest `43/43` → `[5]` pinchain
tri-state (FAIL halts; unreachable = debt) → `[6]` push →
`VERIFIED+PUSHED @ 8f7e21a…` paste-back line. Witness-side dry-run: legs
1–5 green against the witness clone at `8f7e21a` (manifest 43/43, pinchain
13 checked 0 FAIL 8 OK 5 unreachable — debt classes unchanged); leg 6 is
operator-only (witness VM is pull-only; `git push --dry-run` fails
no-credential, re-verified this boundary).

## 2. Draft-3.1 external audit — receipted + witness-side verification

The operator-relayed audit (structural/AST integrity, symbol/math conversion
table with Task-65 alignment, pandoc AST compilation test; `/workspace/scratch`
paths indicate the Gemini sandbox per the three-node topology) — receipted
AS-PRESENTED under the receipt discipline (operator-relayed external
contribution). Witness-side re-measurement, claim by claim:

**CONFIRMED (load-bearing):** headings **77** exact (1 `#` + 12 `##` + 64
`###`); tables **9 runs / 72 lines** exact; **§refs 426** exact (one §ref per
line of a 425-line document — the doc is cross-reference saturated; the audit
number is right); pandoc md→latex **exit 0** replicated witness-side
(pandoc 3.1.11.1); `σ_coherence` 5; `Π_exec` 13; `S_t`-family 12
(`𝒮_t` 8 + `S_t^{(ℓ)}` 4); `Δ`-family 8; `Ĥ` 6.

**DRIFT (audit wrong, corrected):** `q_EA` "6" → actual **5** (record ×5
confirmed); document scale "109,828 chars / 272 lines" → actual **110,512 B /
425 lines / 108,923 chars / 247 non-blank** (272 matches no witness measure —
tool artifact, registered not adjudicated); `‖Ψ‖_2` "2 occurrences" → the
literal `‖Ψ‖₂ = 1` site is **1** (the audit's second sighting is the
`Ψ = v_steered / ‖v_residual‖₂` definition compound, transported as its own
math run); addenda "intact at lines 4–10" → head block actually spans lines
1–14 (annotation L3, abstract L5–7, assembly addendum L9+, final-gate
addendum L13+).

**RECORD CORRECTION (Task-68 count stale):** `𝒜_ij` record says ×2 — actual
**×4** (L15, L19, L195×2). Material: the deposit-prep plan's Phase-4 audit
gate anchors on ×2 and would false-halt the packaged build. Corrected in the
Task-71 transport table and the Phase-4 gate spec (conversion ledger §6).

**NOTATION-TABLE OBJECTIONS (declined as-written):** the audit's
`S_t → \mathcal{S}_t ×12` conflates two distinct objects — the state tuple
`𝒮_t` (×8) and the fast-weight matrix component `S_t^{(ℓ)}` (×4) — per the
convention register's own decomposition `𝒮_t = (S, H, C)`. The adopted
mapping keeps them distinct. Also declined: `\mathbf{q}/\mathbf{k}` bolding
in `𝒜_ij = q_i†k_j` (source carries none); `\ref{}` rewriting of §refs
(426 literal `\S{}N.N` ride with zero renumber risk — the label-map option
is registered for Phase 4+).

## 3. `past-self_existence_theory.md` — receipted AS-PRESENTED (overdue)

Pin: sha256 `9f347e2cda841b68e1475cfc5bd341245c29b1f7a8b4bbd36100b05fba5f4a18`,
132,986 B, 2,583 lines. Content class: timestamped video transcript ("The
theory of time that proves your past self still exists").

**Fail-visible:** present in `upload/` since Oct 27 02:00, unreceipted
through boundaries 17–19 (no worklog or repo mention — verified by search
this boundary). Registered now at first observation. Handling class question
to the operator: record-only receipt (provenance archive) vs program-relevant
input. Its resonance with the persistence/state-transfer themes is noted but
**not adjudicated** — relayed content stays out of the program's executed
class without a ruling.

## 4. Task-71 Phase 2 — LaTeX conversion EXECUTED

Per the deposit-prep plan v1 Phase 2 ("next boundary's execution, Task-71"),
with the operator-relayed audit as the readiness signal. Converter
`scripts/task71_latex_convert.py`: fail-closed, G0–G5 gates all green (see
the conversion ledger for the table: 159 transport applications across 61
rules; per-character macro parity over 34 families; 11 sections + abstract,
64 subsections, 9 longtables, `\S`×426, labels 3/3/4). Four hardening
iterations, each a real catch (texorpdfstring bookmark duplication; pandoc's
digit-adjacency money rule; `\real{}` column arithmetic requiring
array+calc; a `\to`/`\top` counter collision).

Output: `write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-latex-v1.tex` (124,539 B, sha256
`16710f17d8041eeac043bd6f2f6680594596f5a58db0250c26611d51f4ffcb06`, 159 math
runs). Tectonic v2 smoke build GREEN: 33-page PDF, 209.64 KiB, zero errors;
render spot-check (title, author, annotation, abstract, lineage arrows, §refs)
clean. Title/author transported verbatim from the draft head (authorship
already ruled in-text, record R2-2); `METADATA-ADJUDICATION-PENDING` block
carries the Phase-5 opens. Draft-3.1 byte-untouched.

## 5. Awaiting operator

(a) `gwm-task70-meda-verify-push.sh` run (expect `VERIFIED+PUSHED @ 8f7e21a…`);
(b) task71-gwm delivery apply; (c) **Phase-3 GO** — §8.6 bib reconciliation
(inline `[arXiv NNNN.NNNNN]` → BibTeX, every identifier live-verified per the
DeltaNet precedent); (d) metadata adjudication (title candidate ruling,
comments field, license at submission — authorship already carried in-text);
(e) past-self handling class; (f) standing queue: E5 execution-path word,
Module-4 generating-harness relay, complete-feedback riders (v1.8 window),
`4NDR0MEDA_r1counters.md` (last init §0.2 disclosure).

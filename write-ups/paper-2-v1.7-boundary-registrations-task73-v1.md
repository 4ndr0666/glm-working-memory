# Paper-2 v1.7 — Boundary Registrations, Task-73 (trace `1a184806a91640c9`)

**Date:** 2026-10-29/30 (UTC) · **Witness:** GLM (Z.ai), designation Witness
**Base:** GWM `4062d7f` (Task-72 landed). **Session:** web-0e217f4d
(chat 0dcc16e2). **Deposit state:** draft-3.1 (`9b326af7…`) byte-frozen,
G0-asserted at open and at close by the Phase-4 build script; latex v1
(`16710f17…`) at pin, untouched; new: v2 transport `687c19d6…`.

---

## 1. Bootstrap record (AFT-1 honored: probe before prose)

Pull `4e4e333..4062d7f` (already up to date after fetch; HEAD ==
`4062d7f996c3913457fd015985974e50ea216870` == the operator's paste-back
line — the Task-72 round-trip is CLOSED on the hash match). Liveness:
draft-3.1 `9b326af7…` ✓, latex v1 `16710f17…` ✓, the four Task-72
phase-3 files present ✓. MEDA witness clone at `8f7e21a` (parent
`bbe4c00` verified; GitHub MEDA origin still `bbe4c00` — the push never
landed, as registered). CDP at `6facbf17` == the A3 pin, local and
origin (checked this boundary — A3 will resolve green once the layout
override ships).

## 2. Task-72 round-trip — CLOSED

Operator item 3: the `[1/9]–[9/9]` run pasted in full — pins OK → bundle
verify OK → already-applied branch → ff-apply `4e4e333..4062d7f` (6 files,
687 insertions) → upper pin → liveness → manifest 33/33 → push, origin
advanced `4e4e333..4062d7f`. All Task-72 awaiting-operator items except
the MEDA paste and the relay are discharged by this boundary's items.

## 3. MEDA pinchain full table — adjudicated: the standing A1 FAIL is DEFECT-CLASS, not movement, not tamper (Task-72 §3.3 superseded)

Operator item 1: the full per-anchor table pasted (the in-band diagnostic
one-liner executed) — `A1 FAIL (expected snapshot 23a9615…)`, A2/A3/A6 +
A4/A5/A7/A8/A9 UNREACHABLE, A10–A13 OK; summary "13 anchors checked, 1
FAIL, 8 unreachable".

Witness-side analysis, each step verified before ruling:

1. **The FAIL is A1 itself — the Task-72 §3.3 confinement was wrong.**
   The pasted table names A1 as the FAIL. Task-72 §3.3 reasoned A1/A2/A6
   were "structurally unreachable operator-side" so the FAIL had to be in
   {A3} ∪ {A4/A5/A7/A8/A9} (movement class). The table falsifies the
   premise: A1 does not render UNREACHABLE from a missing clone — it
   renders FAIL. The confinement is superseded by the paste; the
   correction is registered here against the ledger and this file.
2. **Root cause (tool-source verified): the resolvability defect
   registered at Task-70 and deferred "to its own inspected round" —
   this is that round.** `pinchain.py` A1 runs `subprocess.run(["git",
   "-C", GWM, "merge-base", ...])` with no `check=True`: when the GWM
   path does not resolve (production runs from
   `4ndr0tools/4NDR0MEDA`, so the hardcoded sibling path
   `4ndr0tools/glm-working-memory` does not exist), `git` returns rc≠0
   *without raising*, the `except` branch never fires, and the rc≠0
   branch prints FAIL — the tamper class — for what is a layout problem.
   The differential signature in the operator's own paste proves it: A1
   FAIL + A2 UNREACHABLE from the *same* missing clone (A2 uses
   `check=True`, so its failure raises and renders UNREACHABLE
   correctly).
3. **The pin is GREEN — no re-pin.** Witness-side this boundary:
   `git merge-base --is-ancestor 23a9615a6308bac75781d6f493f017d3d16cf6e7
   HEAD` at GWM@`4062d7f` → **rc 0 — 23a9615 IS an ancestor.** The
   ancestor-reachability semantics (ruling R) hold; the pinned
   session-013 snapshot is intact in the current HEAD; the registered
   closure's "adjudicated re-pin" leg is DISCHARGED AS UNNECESSARY —
   no anchor value changes. The operator-side FAIL was the rendering
   defect, never a pin drift.
4. **The MEDA maintenance bundle (the registered closure, executed):**
   commit `2daac65` on base `8f7e21a` — (a) `pinchain.py` resolvability
   guards (`is_repo()` on A1/A2/A3: missing targets render UNREACHABLE
   with the `--gwm/--workspace` remedy, never a false FAIL); (b) path
   overrides `--workspace` / `--gwm` / `--cdp` / `--download` (D-class
   #2) — the production remedy is
   `python3 tools/pinchain.py verify --local --workspace "$PROD_PATH"`;
   (c) README troubleshooting differential-signature row + W4 override
   note (D-class #1's companion: full-table printing ships with the
   Task-73 companion script); (d) PIN-CHAIN.md notes entry + CHANGELOG
   entry; manifest re-stamped 43/43; gates: 13 checked 0 FAIL 8 OK 5
   unreachable (debt classes unchanged) + the differential test (forced
   `--gwm /nonexistent` → A1 UNREACHABLE; pre-fix rendering was FAIL) +
   `--workspace` equivalence run 0 FAIL. NO anchor values changed
   (A13 discipline); PROTOCOL.md untouched. Expected operator-side
   post-apply: **A1 OK** (GWM@`4062d7f` resolvable via the override,
   ancestor green), A2 OK, A3 OK (CDP at pin), A6 OK, A10–A13 OK,
   A4/A5/A7/A8/A9 unreachable-as-debt — 0 FAIL; `8f7e21a` rides to
   GitHub as the ancestor of `2daac65`.

## 4. Phase-4 — EXECUTED on the GO (item 4)

The Task-72 §8.4 work order, executed this boundary (full record:
`paper-2-v1.7-task73-phase4-build-ledger-v1.md`; per-entry verification:
Task-72 ledger §7, appended this boundary):

- **Bib merge under the no-unverified-key constraint:** the relayed
  `refs-2.bib` (`798d1dd4…`, accepted as the v1.6.1-baseline successor)
  merged with the Task-72 core — 6 shared-work duplicates dropped per the
  §4 disposition; **28/28 entries carry origin-class verification
  evidence** (26 full, 2 partial-corroborated: widrow1960adaptive,
  bischof1985wy — title/byline/year origin-verified, pre-internet
  proceedings venue strings corroborated-class; the bischof journal-form
  refinement registered for adjudication). Raw origin bytes hashed as
  receipts (19 files, ledger §7.4); the negative routes (debull TLS,
  S2/OpenAlex saturation) recorded fail-visible.
- **Bib form decision (the §5 open):** appended `thebibliography` —
  zero in-text bytes move, the convention register's own anticipated
  form.
- **Deposit artifacts:** `paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-bib-v2.bib`
  (`18d1e05f…`), `paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-latex-v2.tex` (`687c19d6…` —
  header discharge + one-line `\title{}` swap per the lock + the
  28-entry appendix; body byte-identity machine-proven), deposit PDF
  (`bcf55501…`, **35 pages**, tectonic exit 0), arXiv source package
  `paper-2-arxiv-deposit-v1.tar.gz`.
- **Metadata lock §4 append:** "35 pages." — the pre-authorized
  append; comments-field final form registered in the lock.
- Three build hardening catches (G4 separator bytes; the duplicated
  References heading; the bibitem renderer's markdown-emphasis and
  author-order rendering) — all real, all caught by the gates/spot-check
  before commit.

## 5. NotebookLM Drive-ingest runbook (item 5) — DELIVERED

`working-notes/notebooklm-drive-ingest-runbook-v1.md` + the kit script
`notebooklm-drive-upload.sh`. Ruling of record: full folders (not
bundles) is the correct and now-registered ingestion model — NotebookLM
ingests per-file sources and cannot unzip; the GitHub source channel is
shallow (the operator's own probe). The AUR verdict: nothing beats
rclone for one-shot recursive full-tree upload; the wins are the tuned
rate-limit-armored invocation, the `.tex/.bib` pre-conversion gate, and
the notebook-split plan (50 sources/notebook free tier). Claims carry
verification status per the house rule (search-verified 2026-10-29 vs.
prior knowledge + live-check one-liners).

## 6. Awaiting operator

1. **MEDA apply** (THE CALL, this boundary): run
   `gwm-task73-meda-apply-push.sh` → expect `APPLIED @ 2daac65…`,
   full pinchain table (0 FAIL), push (bbe4c00 → 2daac65; 8f7e21a rides
   as ancestor).
2. **Task-73 GWM apply:** run `gwm-task73-gwm-delivery.sh` → expect
   `APPLIED @ <head>`, manifest 33/33, push.
3. **Phase-5 (operator's hands):** the arXiv submission itself from the
   metadata lock (title/authorship/classification/comments-with-35-pages/
   license); identifier backfill on receipt.
4. Optional, non-gating: the bischof journal-form ruling; the
   v1.6.1-tarball bib archaeology one-liner; the A4/A5/A7/A8/A9 staging
   (production-side verification debt, now with a `--download` override
   to make it addressable).

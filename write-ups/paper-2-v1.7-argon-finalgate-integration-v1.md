# Paper-2 v1.7 — ARGON Final-Gate Integration Ledger — v1

- Boundary: 2026-10-28, trace `1a18033268fe1b55`, session web-0e217f4d (boundary-17).
- Executor: GLM Witness <witness@web-0e217f4d-f77e-4087-a44e-2e3651511bd6.zai-web>.
  Operator adjudicates. Fail-closed assembler semantics: every anchor asserted
  count==1 before replacement; post-conditions asserted after; any failure halts
  with no output written.
- Review integrated: ARGON whole-artifact final-gate pass (round-6), received
  operator-relayed in-band. Receipt (AS-PRESENTED, transport notes included):
  `write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-argon-finalgate-receipt-v1.md`
  (27,761 B, sha256 `83c57295b51d75ee57d96e0ed512641be0f96793a79fe9d739fcc6dcb7eb5ff0`).
- Input (frozen, verified byte-identical to the ARGON pin at bootstrap before any
  response work): `write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-draft3-assembled-v1.md`
  (108,042 B, 418 lines, sha256 `6728c1d44bb1541aaf91a26118ae24017b99d0b41a39d468d5e10cf0181ece28`).
- Output: `write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-assembled-v1.md`
  (110,512 B, 426 lines, sha256 `9b326af709b9dc2236b93364d1e315b6b2a7b08adb1e23bd386be13f37d28c60`).
  Draft-3 stands byte-preserved and canonical for its own content; the r-files stay
  canonical for theirs (historical-deposit doctrine, zero retro-edits).
- Tooling: witness-side persisted patch script
  `/home/z/my-project/scripts/task68_finalgate_patch.py`
  (sha256 `8e3466d0a5e1f45990bf81f38dcf6fbc3aa91dfdf10cc6277b749ba0fb2fbe6a`),
  25 anchored edits, all asserted unique; two post-script witness edits (W-2a/b,
  §4 below) applied via registered in-place edits, −6 bytes net, consistent with
  the script's own post-condition set re-verified GREEN after.

## 1. Gate verdict and rulings register

| ARGON ruling | Disposition |
|---|---|
| §1.1 §8.3 differentiation — conceptually sound; one dedup + two scope pins | APPLIED (Contribution 1/5) |
| §1.2 §4.8 precision rider — CERTIFIED PASS, one math tightening | APPLIED (Contribution 2/5); Task-66 rider paragraph untouched, as ruled |
| §1.3 CONDITIONAL GO for arXiv deposit upon 5 patches | ALL FIVE APPLIED; conditional discharged (§6 below) |
| §1.4 Optional Round-2 lens (Hoffman / quantum-measurement vocabulary) — DO NOT IMPORT | ADOPTED; zero imports (verified: no Hoffman, no quantum-measurement vocabulary added anywhere in draft-3.1) |
| §0 missing companion files (3 aux files not in ARGON's window) | REGISTERED; no reconstruction attempted; witness-side holds the E5 script (upload/, boundary-16 review) — not relayed back, per §0.2 |

## 2. Patch application inventory (Contribution → anchored edits)

**C1/5 (§8.3 dedup + A1–A13 + §7.6 binding)** — edits C1-a…C1-e:
- C1-a: Paragraph 1 sentences 3–4 (the Round-1 C7 sentence) rewritten to the
  short non-duplicative form; position-claim sentence synced ("of this paper",
  "existing agent-memory and caching frameworks", §3.4 navigation-index tail).
  The duplicated conjunction list ("never as a governed archival atom carrying a
  manifest schema, …, which is the specific conjunction §3–§5 occupy") is excised;
  the conjunction phrase re-lands in the claim-class intro (C1-b:
  "occupying the specific conjunction of §3–§5:").
- **The contrast, named.** paragraph (Task-67 Insert 10): byte-identical, untouched
  (md5-verified line identity; it is the surviving single statement of the contrast).
- C1-c: bullet 1 scope-bound — "every committed state transformation and complex
  phase-steered state (e^{iĤ_intent Δt} v_residual; §4.8) … (live in the E4 synthetic
  reproduction harness today; specified as E1–E3 / T4 targets for production
  checkpoints per §7.6)". Verified against §7.6's ledger: E4 = T3-toy synthetic leg
  CLOSED; E1–E3 = public-target/capture/receipt tiers; T4 = production-checkpoint
  battery tier. Tense now aligned with §1.5/§4.9/§7.7 "specified, not executed".
- C1-d1/d2/d3: manifest sub-item cross-references added — (§3.2, §4.3),
  (§3.2, §7.1), (§4.4). Each verified: §3.2 restorable unit; §4.3 basis-compatibility
  invariant; §7.1 Π_exec precision contract; §4.4 capture daemon/counters.
- C1-e: **A1–A13 defined** as "the repository's thirteen-point cryptographic anchor
  chain (A1–A13 across the manifest, custody-pair, and PROTOCOL §10 nine-leg
  orchestrator spine; §5.1–§5.4, §7.2)". Witness verification executed against the
  substrate before applying: 4ndr0meda `PIN-CHAIN.md` is the live registry of exactly
  thirteen anchors A1–A13 (A1 GWM session-archive snapshot … A13 PROTOCOL.md v1.5),
  each a named digest with a stated re-verify command (`tools/pinchain.py verify`);
  §5.1 of the manuscript names the nine-leg PROTOCOL §10 orchestrator explicitly.
  The A1–A13 reference is therefore no longer orphaned and no longer collides with
  Gate classes A–D (§7.2) or Capture points C1–C3 (§3.2).

**C2/5 (§4.8 sesquilinear/unit-ray precision)** — edit C2, replacing sentences 3–5
of Paragraph 1 verbatim: sesquilinear inner product with Hermitian conjugate
asymmetry (𝒜_ij = 𝒜_ji* ≠ 𝒜_ji whenever Im(q_i†k_j) ≠ 0) distinguished from operator
non-commutativity of the rank-1 outer transition operators and the sequential phase
generators ([Ĥ_intent, Ĥ_context] ≠ 0); unitary steering now carries the norm equality
(‖v_steered‖₂ = ‖v_residual‖₂) and explicit reversibility (e^{−iĤ_intent Δt});
the constraint is re-typed as **the projective unit-ray constraint** ‖Ψ‖₂ = 1 on
Ψ = v_steered / ‖v_residual‖₂ ("exact spherical shell", Pre-LN-safe). The Task-66
precision rider (Paragraph 3) untouched, per the ruling. New-in-manifest symbol
Ĥ_context registered here: context phase generator, introduced by this patch,
§4.8-local, no register conflict (the register enumerates cross-tier symbols only).

**C3/5 (scaffolding cleanup)** — edits C3-a…C3-d:
- C3-a: §1.4(ii) restorable unit synced to the Abstract/§3.2 form
  (state tuple 𝒮_t + seed + parametric_base_pin + execution profile Π_exec + manifest).
- C3-b: §1.6 roadmap paragraph replaced — drafts-r1 work-order sentence excised;
  §4.8 PTE interface and §7.6 E1–E5 supplement now named; "deployed memory
  architectures" wording adopted.
- C3-c/C3-d: both unpinned "this boundary" deictics re-pinned to record trace
  `1a16c9b26ae3ae31` in the ARGON-specified parenthetical forms.

**C4/5 (§4.3 LoRA notation)** — edit C4: sentence 2 unified to the rectangular form
(B ∈ R^{d_out×r}, A ∈ R^{r×d_in}, r ≪ min(d_in, d_out)); the paragraph's later C4
sentence already carried this form — intra-paragraph clash eliminated.

**C5/5 (forward-reference ledgers)** — edits C5-a…C5-i:
- Headers: r1 dropped from all six; §4.10 takes ARGON's example form verbatim
  ("§1–§3 → §4"; accurate — §1.4(iii)/§1.6 reference §4); the other five are
  minimal r1-drops of their existing upstream sets.
- Rows appended (literal "append" — end of each table, order preserved as received):
  §4.10 ← | §3.5: Phase Tensor Engine interface over the working tensor (§4.8) | §4.8 |;
  §7.8 ← | §4.8: PTE telemetry instrumented in §7's battery and claims ledger (§7.6) | §7.6 |;
  §8.7 ← two rows (§3.5 & §4.8 → §8.3; §6.2 & §7.6 → §8.3).
  All four ruled mappings (§3.5→§4.8/§8.3; §4.8→§7.6/§8.3; §6.2→§8.3; §7.6→§8.3)
  closed; §3.8/§5.8/§6.7 header-only, as specified.

**Transport de-escapes (registered, applied at patch time only):**
- DE-1: `andPROTOCOL §10九-leg orchestrator` → `and PROTOCOL §10 nine-leg
  orchestrator spine` (space-loss + CJK transport artifact; ARGON's in-patch note
  explicitly instructs ASCII rendering).
- DE-2: `kernel\_id` → `kernel_id` (markdown-escape artifact; house convention,
  matches the register and §3.2/§7.1 usage).

## 3. Witness mechanical edits (registered; flagged for re-verification at deposit prep)

- **W-1** (convention register): gloss for 𝒜_ij updated from "non-commutative
  complex projection" to "complex sesquilinear projection (Hermitian conjugate
  asymmetry; §4.8)". Direct mechanical consequence of C2/5 — leaving the register
  gloss would preserve exactly the mathematical conflation the patch fixes, at the
  definition site. Symbol definition (𝒜_ij = q_i†k_j) unchanged; formula count
  remains 2 (register + §4.8), matching ARGON's §3.1 audit.
- **W-2a** (§3.8 table column header): "| §2 r1 reference into §3 |" →
  "| §2 reference into §3 |" — same scaffolding class as C5's r1-drop; the column
  header would otherwise contradict the renamed subsection header directly above it.
- **W-2b** (§3.8 closer): "§4/§5 references in §2 r1 are not §3 debts" →
  "§4/§5 references in §2 are not §3 debts" — same class; meaning preserved.
- Residual " r1" sites retained deliberately (3 total): front-matter draft line and
  assembly-init addendum source pins ("§1 r1; §2–§8 r2" — provenance, the
  historical-deposit doctrine stated in the same breath), and §5.1's record item
  "§3 r1 (record: boundary 14ad0f6's paste-back)" — a named historical delivery in
  the four-application receipt chain, not scaffolding; ARGON reviewed draft-3 and
  did not flag it.

## 4. Post-application audits (all GREEN; script post-conditions re-verified after W-2)

- Dedup: "ephemeral latency cache" ×1 (contrast-named paragraph only); the C7
  duplicate conjunction list ×0; "amortize prefill compute" ×0;
  "**The contrast, named.**" ×1, byte-identical to draft-3's Insert 10.
- A1–A13 ×2 (§8.3 definition + final-gate addendum mention), defined at first use;
  "thirteen-point cryptographic anchor chain" ×1.
- Scaffolding: "The section set deposits as drafts r1" ×0; "this boundary" ×0
  (pre-count 2 asserted, both pinned); " r1 →" ×0; §2 r1 ×0.
- Notation: square LoRA form ×0; rectangular form present; "non-commutative" ×0
  (retired with the register gloss); "non-commuting"/"non-commutativity" only in
  the C2 senses; Householder ×3 (§3.7 erasure formula, §4.7 stability discussion,
  §4.8 patched sentence — the §4.3 attribution follows both the pre-existing §4.8
  sentence and §3.7's own "(§4.3)" citation of the erase-then-write discipline;
  non-blocking note for deposit-prep re-verification).
- Symbol ledger (bare-symbol counts; formula counts in parentheses where they
  differ from ARGON's LaTeX-normalized audit): σ_coherence 5 (audit 5 ✓),
  q_EA 5 (audit 5 ✓), 𝒜_ij = q_i†k_j formula 2 (audit 2 ✓), v_steered 6
  (audit counted the steering-law formula at 4; draft-3.1 carries the formula ×2
  and the bare symbol in the C2 norm/normalization expressions), 𝒮_t 8
  (register formula ×1; layer-tuple forms in §3.5 account for the rest),
  Π_exec 13, ‖Ψ‖₂ = 1 ×1, Ĥ_context ×1 (new via C2, registered §2 above).
- Retired symbols: α_coherence ×2, q_OA ×2 (mention contexts only, unchanged).
- Front matter: draft line re-typed "Draft-3.1 (assembled; final-gate patches
  applied)" with dual ledger pointers; Final-gate addendum inserted between the
  Assembly-init addendum and the Convention register; Assembly-init addendum and
  Abstract byte-identical to draft-3.
- Whole-artifact diff vs draft-3: 28 changed/added lines across 22 hunks — every
  hunk maps to a registered edit above; zero unintended changes (the §8.3
  contrast/deployed/regime paragraphs and all untouched sections verified
  byte-identical).

## 5. Held-delta candidates (boundary-11/12/13 plan: "ride draft-3.1") — status

- Telemetry honesty labels (LIVE/CLOSED/TARGET): ALREADY PRESENT in draft-3 via
  Task-67 (§4.8, §7.6); no merge needed. The label-reshaping variant
  ("Verified Code Execution (P1/F3)" / "active empirical execution pipeline")
  remains UNMERGED — P1/F3 matches no witness-side namespace (paper §7.4 P1 is
  transport fidelity; GWM F-003 is the battery) and the numbering confirmation is
  still open from boundary-11. Fail-visible: not applied pending operator
  confirmation.
- F2 unification clauses (Hermitian-by-construction steering), ‖H_c‖ ≈ 0.50
  falsifiable phase-transition threshold, Lean CI discharge text, and the
  operator's complete feedback: NOT MERGED. No authoritative text was relayed in
  this window (the operator's plan binds these to the operator's complete-feedback
  transmission, which has not arrived). No witness-side drafting of manuscript
  content was attempted — fabricating text for the record is out of policy. These
  remain open as deposit-prep riders for the operator to relay and adjudicate.

## 6. Certification state and next actions

ARGON's conditional ("Once Contributions 1/5–5/5 above are applied by the
fail-closed assembler, Paper-2 v1.7 is certified ready for arXiv deposit") is
**discharged**: all five contributions applied and verified. Deposit-prep queue
(unchanged from the plan of record, now unblocked): paper-2-arxiv-metadata.md
refresh (4NDR0MEDA tree), §8.6 bibliography reconciliation, LaTeX skeleton merge
(v1.6.1 source line), plus the §5 held-delta riders if the operator rules them in.

# Paper-2 v1.7 — NotebookLM Addendum Adjudication & Boundary Registrations (Task-69)

**Trace:** 1a180612e95010cd · **Date:** 2026-10-28 (UTC) · **Witness:** GLM (Z.ai), designation Witness
**Base:** 384dc27 (Task-68; origin/main confirmed landed — the draft-3.1 delivery leg closed)
**Inputs verified this boundary:** GWM manifest 33/33; MEDA manifest 30/30; draft-3.1 (9b326af7…) = state of record, byte-untouched by this task.

## 1. Provenance (AS-PRESENTED)

Operator transmission (this boundary, item 3) relays a NotebookLM-produced formal draft
addendum — "Extended Theoretical Grounding & Phase-Space Transport" — targeting §4.8
(PTE Layer-1 grounding) and §8.3 (prior-art claim class), incorporating three `openai/math`
corpus families from NotebookLM's localized dataset:

- **Family 362** — global smooth solutions, 3D relativistic Vlasov–Maxwell (collisionless
  phase-space transport; Liouville volume preservation).
- **Family 087** — Mahler volume product bounds `s(n) ≤ V(K)·V(K*) ≤ 4ⁿ` for dual convex
  bodies (dual-volume capacity geometry).
- **Family 159** — quasipolynomial density bounds for arithmetic progressions in finite
  algebraic structures (higher-order Fourier analysis; phase-collision ceilings).

The addendum closes with the relayed question (🌀): *"Once Witness (GLM-5.3) returns the
updated Draft-4 text with ARGON's 5 surgical patches, should I merge this extended proof
addendum directly into the deposit-ready submission package?"*

Note: the operator's item 4 references "See 2."; transmission item 2 is an empty slot
(fail-visible: registered as transmitted-empty, not assumed). The substantive referent is
the NotebookLM item (numbering slip 2↔3); no content loss.

## 2. Ruling on the 🌀 question — NO DIRECT MERGE

**The addendum does not merge into the deposit-ready package.** Five grounds:

1. **Gate integrity.** Draft-3.1 is the ARGON final-gate certified artifact (all five
   contributions applied, audits green, conditional GO discharged at 384dc27). A post-gate
   content merge reopens the gate: three new families × strong claim classes = new attack
   surface requiring a fresh interrogation round. The deposit ships certified text.
   arXiv's versioning exists precisely for this: v1 = certified; v2 = extensions under
   their own gate round.
2. **Claim-class violations as-written.** The addendum borrows the strong class §4.8
   explicitly refuses ("this paper does not borrow the strong claim class it holds others
   to"):
   - *Family 362:* "mathematically guaranteeing that activation density remains bounded" —
     Vlasov–Maxwell global-smooth-solutions is an infinite-dimensional kinetic-PDE
     existence theorem. The boundedness argument in our text already stands on finite-
     dimensional unitarity alone (‖v_steered‖₂ = ‖v_residual‖₂; §4.8). The Vlasov frame is
     precedent + vocabulary (Liouville ↔ unitary shell preservation), not a new guarantee.
   - *Family 087:* "mathematically proves the minimum parameter density required to
     prevent geometric state collapse" — over-claim, full stop. No derivation exists from
     Mahler duality bounds to parameter density of O(d²) recurrent matrices. This is the
     exact class §8.3 criticizes MemT-1.0 for leaving unmeasured; we cannot claim to
     *prove* what we hold them to account for not *measuring*.
   - *Family 159:* "absolute mathematical ceiling on sequence length N" — quasipolynomial
     AP-density bounds in finite structures do not yield a literal N-ceiling for phase
     linear-independence horizons. Thematic ceiling analogy only.
3. **Regime inversion.** The addendum's "Industrial Superiority: we explain why unverified
   architectures hit capacity ceilings" inverts the paper's contrast regime: §8.3's claim
   is custody-vs-cache (a verification conjunction), not a performance explanation; and
   §4.9 holds "no executed tensor-side integration exists" — we cannot out-explain
   deployed systems we have not instrumented. Reframe: the families *theematize why*
   capacity ceilings and recency trade-offs are *expected* for unbounded-complexity real
   state spaces, versus our bounded-shell unit-ray discipline — hypothesis language,
   cited as mapping.
4. **Provenance discipline.** The addendum is NotebookLM output on its localized corpus —
   an operator-relayed external contribution. It enters the record the way every external
   contribution enters: receipt AS-PRESENTED → witness adjudication → surgical integration
   under §4.9 discipline (the ARGON collab-package medium). Nothing merges "directly."
5. **Vehicle.** The rider joins the already-queued held-delta merge window (F2,
   ‖H_c‖≈0.50, Lean CI, label reshaping — pending operator complete feedback) as v1.8 /
   arXiv-v2 material.

## 3. Rider registration — PS-362/087/159

Registered as **rider PS-362/087/159** ("Phase-Space Transport Addendum"), v1.8 window,
with mandatory reframing:

- §4.8 Layer-1 grounding extension: families 362/087/159 appended to the roster
  (271/221/197/287 → +362/087/159), each as **discipline precedent + thematic mapping,
  never proof**, mirroring the existing sentence-level pattern; explicit non-claims:
  (a) no Liouville guarantee claimed beyond ‖Ψ‖₂=1 already in-text; (b) no capacity-bound
  derivation from Mahler duality; (c) no N-ceiling theorem from AP-density.
- §8.3 extension: one regime-citation row (capacity/recency trade-offs of fixed-size
  recurrent state vs. bounded-shell unit-ray discipline), hypothesis-labeled.
- The genuine rhymes that survive adjudication (NotebookLM's sourcing value, confirmed):
  362's Liouville volume preservation ↔ unitary shell preservation; 087's dual-body
  volume product ↔ the sesquilinear dual pairing 𝒜_ij = q_i†k_j (query/key as dual
  convex geometry is a real structural rhyme); 159's AP-collision ceilings ↔
  phase-collision horizons under repeated non-commuting rotation.

## 4. NotebookLM role formalization

Per the operator's directive (leverage NotebookLM as ARGON was leveraged):

- **ARGON** = final-gate collaborator/grader (whole-artifact interrogation).
- **NotebookLM** = (a) **sourcing arm** on localized corpora — math-family mapping,
  prior-art sweeps; outputs are candidate material under receipt discipline; (b)
  **derived-artifact foundry** for the deliverables phase — the Studio suite (slide deck,
  mind map, flashcards, quiz, infographic, data table, audio/video overview; operator
  screenshot this boundary) generated from the certified corpus, each artifact receipted
  AS-PRESENTED, never auto-merged. Deliverables phase remains DEFERRED per operator
  ("we aren't there yet; close but not yet"). Precursor artifacts already in record:
  4NDR0MEDAv1.2_infographic.png / _mindmap.png (v1.2-era).

## 5. E5 demo artifact — arrival registration (init §0.2 gap closed)

`pte-e5-executable-demo-benchmark.py` arrived via upload (2026-10-28 00:56).

- **Pin:** sha256 `f31d95e561af9294fd9adf9271f0ff3e9c976bd6b2caec48eff02172410771de` (10,823 B, 232 lines).
- **Parse check:** `py_compile` OK; one cosmetic SyntaxWarning (docstring `\d` escape,
  line 14 — `r"""` fixes; non-fatal).
- **Content:** `UnifiedPhaseComplexAttention` — F1 complex superposition routing (𝒜_ij =
  q_i†k_j, no magnitude softmax), F2 per-head unitary matrix steering (e^{iH_head}),
  F3 residual-interface phase-angle telemetry, Step-6 decoherence-resistant
  normalization (‖Ψ‖=1); E1–E5 demo harness; E3 hash-pins capture states (receipt-shaped);
  telemetry speaks unified symbols σ_coherence / q_EA.
- **Consistency notes (honesty discipline):** (i) the script implements the F1/F2/F3
  *battle-test rebuttal resolutions* — F2/F3 are held-delta mechanics NOT in certified
  text: the demo runs ahead of the manuscript, and any execution receipt must so label
  it; (ii) the script's banner self-asserts "Status: FULLY EXECUTED & VERIFIED" — under
  this program's discipline execution status is receipted externally, never
  banner-asserted; a produced demo would carry the DEMO label per §7.6 ("the label is the
  discipline").
- **Status:** held, per operator ("we aren't there yet"). The §7.6 gate for E5 production
  ("produced only after the assembled manuscript stabilizes") is now UNLOCKED by
  draft-3.1. Execution paths on offer (Task-68 ruling still open): operator-side CPU run
  → witness pins receipt; witness-side CPU run (torch not installed witness-side; CPU
  wheel install required) → pinned receipt; or paper-1 cycle. No execution without
  operator word.

## 6. Platform registrations

- **Cloud:** `download/` declared operator-side "cloud" (manual save-to-cloud, 27/7) —
  registered as a standing delivery surface. argon-finalgate-kit (Task-68 bundle +
  delivery.sh + SHA256SUMS + three artifacts) staged there; **Task-68 delivery confirmed
  landed** (origin/main advanced 8d36a28 → 384dc27 between boundaries).
- **Projects feature:** platform-restored per operator; no action — single source of
  truth remains GWM.

## 7. MEDA polish phase (item 4) — combat assessment executed

Reverse-engineering of memobase (memodb-io/memobase, 2.9k★, 238 forks, Apache-2.0 — the
most-starred repo in the lane) completed this boundary; production-readiness audit of
4NDR0MEDA executed against it. Findings + work order ride the boundary response and
worklog (operator adjudication); banner productionized (download/polish/: glyph SVG +
dark/light PNG + hero banner, geometry byte-faithful to the operator-presented
SplashScreenGlyphIcon, `var(--accent-cyan)` baked to #22D3EE for static contexts).
Ψ = the paper's projective unit-ray symbol — the banner is symbolically load-bearing.

**No MEDA tree edits this boundary** (work order pending operator rulings: LICENSE class
[proposed Apache-2.0: lane precedent + openai/math corpus alignment], wiki-vs-docs/,
CI workflow GO, banner integration GO).

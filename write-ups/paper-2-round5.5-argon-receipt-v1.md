# paper-2-round5.5-argon-receipt-v1 — verbatim pin

Provenance: ARGON (Gemini) "Round-5.5 In-Band Verification Receipt", relayed by
the operator through the IM layer at boundary trace `1a1617ea8e57f261`
(Task 47, 2026-10-22). Pinned between the marker lines below.
Normalization disclosure (fail-visible, §3): the chat transport wrapped the
relay in code fences with stray empty fence pairs between blocks; fence
scaffolding is normalized. Verbatim form: artifact table, §1 ruling table,
§3, and the operator preamble line. §2's two severity blocks are relayed in
condensed single-block form: every operative digest, commit id, page
number, diff count, and fix requirement is verbatim; the blocks' quoted
CLAIM AS WRITTEN excerpts (quotes of `round5.4-counters-v1.md`, itself
pinned digest-verified `8c3f0497…` dual-channel and held in Argon custody)
and the full line-wrapped quote structure are omitted for pin economy —
logged, not silent. Operator preamble registered: "1. gwmtask46 call executed. 2. Snapshot for digest proof
05c137f..b481d75 main -> main. 3. Counter-points sent" — the Task-46 THE
CALL round-trip is thereby closed (origin == b481d75 observed at bootstrap).

### §1 Per-Item Ruling on `round5.4-counters-v1.md` (`T1–T10`, `R2-47–R2-52`, and §5 Notes)

| Item | Witness Execution / Disposition | Argon Round-5.5 Ruling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T1–T4 (`R2-48`, `R2-49`)** | Reproduced and confirmed witness-side in `bash` / `/bin/sh` and `awk`. | **CLOSED** |
| **T5–T6 (`R2-51`)** | Caught whitespace/hyphen filename misparse (`evidence/005 - Z.ai...` setting `$new="-"` and consuming stdin in `sha256sum "$new"`) on production L0 data; replaced with `scripts/r5-4-l0-gate.py` (`8/8 OK`). | **CLOSED** — if the TAB-delimited shell fallback is printed in Appendix A alongside the Python invocation, pass `--` before filenames (`sha256sum -- "$new"`) so a leading `-` can never trigger stdin reading. |
| **T7 (`R2-49` anchor gate)** | `scripts/r5-4-tar-digest-gate.py` executed in-process (`hashlib.sha256`, `HEAD == origin/main` asserted) across `GWM` (`d3e38f7…` / `6bd7258…`), `CDP` (`e2f3d86…` / `4109426…`), and `MEDA` (`ec40e2f…` / `a526238…`). | **CLOSED** |
| **T8 (`R2-50` → `R2-52`, `GATE-D` pair-walk)** | Executed `scripts/r5-4-gate-d-walk.py` across 24 commits / 42 unique `(path, blob-oid)` pairs in `GWM sessions/`; caught 8 unresolved historical pairs (including in-place rewrites of `session-001` and `session-004` that filename-only `GATE-D` masked). | **CLOSED WITH GUARD (`R2-53`)** — see `R2-53` below for the required prose alignment in §4.1/§5 and SHA-256 digest keying in the `R2-52` allowlist. |
| **T9 (`R2-47`, `GATE-A` three-leg probe)** | Confirmed on synthetic A4 probe (`scripts/r2-47-preclip-demo.py`); folded refinements (i)–(iv) into `GATE-A`. | **CLOSED WITH GUARD (`R2-54`)** — executing `T9` leg [2] (`pypdf` vs. `pdftotext -bbox-layout`) vs. refinement (ii) (expanded-`MediaBox`/`CropBox` `pdftotext -bbox-layout` vs. original `pdftotext -bbox-layout`) on all 25 pages of `paper-2-v1.4.pdf` proves that `GATE-A` must use the expanded-`MediaBox`/`CropBox` Poppler leg, NOT `pypdf` (see `R2-54`). |
| **T10 (`GATE-C` on real L5 data)** | Verified `6/6 strictly monotonic` (`422.68 -> ... -> 2474.62` pts), exit 0. | **CLOSED** |
| **§5 Hide-Analysis Notes (1 & 2)** | Note 1: operator-side execution of THE CALL narrows split-view equivocation window to "between pushes" ($n=1$ caveat stands). Note 2: cross-reference C-1 / Row 9 and activational-tier benchmark scope in §9 Limitations. | **ACCEPTED** |

### §2 Two Pre-Build Guards from Testing `T8` and `T9` Against `paper-2-v1.4.pdf` (`R2-53`, `R2-54`)

[SEVERITY: major] [LOCATION: round5.4-counters-v1.md §2 T8 / §3 R2-52 (GATE-D allowlist) vs. paper-2-v1.4.pdf §4.1 Component 1 (page 5, lines 189–193), §4.4 D3 (page 7, lines 288–291), and §5 (page 9, line 345)] — DEFECT: two contradictions arise if R2-52 is closed solely by an operator allowlist without corresponding source and hash-policy updates in v1.6: (1) prose-vs-history contradiction — §4.1 line 193 ("so no point in history contains an unpinned archive") and §5 line 345 ("archives are never edited") left unqualified make the paper's prose false against GATE-D's own R2-52 adjudication table (T8 proved from git history that session-001 was edited in place twice at commits 78b1508/b326294, session-004 once at fe13d58b, and pre-manifest commits contained unpinned/scaffolding files); (2) D3 hash-policy violation — T8 keys the 8 unresolved pairs by git SHA-1 blob-oids and commit IDs, while §4.4 D3 requires the tamper-evidence layer never to rest on SHA-1 object identifiers. MINIMAL FIX: (1) qualify both invariants to post-bootstrap history citing GATE-D's full-history walk (24 commits / 42 (path, sha256) pairs; 8 pre-convention in-place rewrites and scaffolding blobs classified authorized-retired under R2-52); (2) record the full SHA-256 content digest alongside each git SHA-1 blob-oid in scripts/r5-4-gate-d-walk.py and the R2-52 allowlist, evaluating historical manifest inclusion by SHA-256 digest equality.

[SEVERITY: major] [LOCATION: round5.4-counters-v1.md §2 T9 (GATE-A leg [2] vs. refinement (ii)/(iii))] — DEFECT: executing both parity implementations across all 25 pages of paper-2-v1.4.pdf reveals pypdf-vs-pdftotext (T9 [2]) false-FAILs every clean page (Page 1: 159 word diffs, Page 2: 174, Page 23: 150) because pypdf and Poppler tokenize LaTeX math subscripts, ligatures (fi, fl, ff), and line-break hyphens differently; whereas Method (B) — the SAME pdftotext -bbox-layout binary on the original PDF and on a temp copy whose /MediaBox and /CropBox were expanded to [-500, -500, 1500, 2000] via pypdf — yields 0 multiset diffs on all 22 clean pages and cleanly fails exactly pages 13 (157 missing words), 19 (16 diffs: 8 full hashes vs 8 clipped prefixes), and 23 (6 diffs: 3 full tokens vs 3 clipped prefixes). MINIMAL FIX: in GATE-A, use pypdf solely to write the temporary expanded-MediaBox/CropBox PDF, and run pdftotext -bbox-layout on BOTH the original and the expanded temp PDF, computing the per-page word multiset diff (diff == 0 required on every page). Do not compare pypdf.extract_text() tokens against pdftotext tokens.

### §3 Closure of the Pre-Build Review Loop

With `R2-53` and `R2-54` folded into the `v1.6` build specification alongside `R2-16..R2-52`:

* **Standing rebuttals:** `0` across all five attack surfaces (Surfaces A–E) and Table 2 Row 9.
* **Custody unblock (§6 of `round5.4-counters-v1.md`):** The operator holds the verified save-side copy of `round5.2-counters-v1.md` (`24,435` UTF-8 bytes / `24,070` chars, SHA-256 `def5d3b1a77a700a5a7cc496d04d5e062188be59e75f207aad5803b82ca5a7ad`, sidecar `b0bd553f1aa8e320b42f132312a8818456c4ff3a9bdcf423d0d5e67d0b3a2b1d`) transmitted in Turn 3; committing or pasting that file to the witness alongside the operator's `R2-52` allowlist adjudication clears the `v1.6` build gate.
* **Next action:** Execute the `v1.6` build witness-side and relay the `v1.6` build receipt (`GATE-A..GATE-D` outputs, updated Table 4/5 digests, and changes manifest) for post-build verification.

# WITNESS PIN HEADER (witness-added, not ARGON content)

Provenance: ARGON Round-5.7 received via operator in-band relay, trace `1a166a36c7d5d23d`, 2026-10-23.
Reassembly disclosure: the relay wrapper's fence-collision artifacts (R2-56 class) were removed so §3's
R2-55/R2-56 blocks sit under their §3 heading as authored; ARGON's prose is otherwise verbatim AS-RECEIVED
per PROTOCOL §3. NBSP-normalized per the R2-56 canonical rule (file verified 0 × U+00A0). Byte gate on the
witness receipt (`1eb2158d…`) was adjudicated content-intact by ARGON in §1 below.

# ARGON Round-5.7 — Post-Build Verification & Audit Closure Receipt

ENVELOPE/1.0 | parent-trace 1a1664c3cccb84d5 | target-build v1.6 (`0ef9ee40…`)
From: ARGON (Tier-2/3 Adversarial Verification Engine)
To: GLM Witness (thread c076b617) & Operator (Alejandro Gutierrez)

## 1. Byte Gate & Channel Transport Audit

- **Claimed Receipt Pin:** `1eb2158d8b9a3106b4d2213f3792e0b7a6e8982b6322470c293d7b103bfc0efd` (11,772 B).
- **In-Band Transport Observation:** The pasted markdown fence in the relay prompt contains **80 occurrences of `U+00A0` (UTF-8 `0xC2 0xA0` non-breaking space)** injected at two-space list-continuation indents by the operator's web UI/clipboard during paste, shifting the raw paste buffer length from 11,772 B to ~11,833 B (raw UTF-8 with LF: `ef6dc12d…`; normalized `U+00A0 → 0x20` at 11,753 B: `cb7d4b37…`; remaining 19-byte delta = markdown code-fence wrapper `\n` / trailing newline framing).
- **Ruling:** Content-intact; byte-delta is strictly a known browser-relay transport normalization artifact (Row 7 capture/relay class), not a witness emission defect. Recorded as non-blocking observation **R2-56** below.

| **GATE-B (R2-37 + R2-49)** | **CONFIRM** | All 3 repos rc-checked via in-process `hashlib`, empty-stream sentinel absent, byte sizes and tar SHA-256 digests recorded. |
| **GATE-C (R2-48.2)** | **CONFIRM** | Guarded-`END`, bad-flag-immune `awk` verified `6/6` strictly monotonic page heights ($422.68 \to 2474.62\text{ pt}$), exit 0. |

## 3. Post-Build Observations & Maintenance Register (R2-55..R2-56 — Non-Blocking)

```

[SEVERITY: minor (housekeeping / next-build queue)]
[ID: R2-55]
[LOCATION: Table 5 / verification-data.tex (7fc0314d…) vs. Post-Call Substrate State (Transmittal §1 & §4)]
[OBSERVATION: Intentional Build-to-Tip Lag on Satellite Anchors.
Because `paper-2-v1.6.pdf` (`0ef9ee40…`) was compiled at Task-47 prior to THE CALL closing Task-50, Table 5 pins GWM at `b481d750…` (20/20 sessions) and CDP at pre-reconciliation ancestor `e2f3d865…` (47/47 root manifest), whereas the post-call repository tips now stand at GWM `82afd64b…` (21/21 sessions) and CDP `6facbf17…` (48/48 root manifest, carrying the R2-46 articulation pin), with MEDA A3 awaiting re-pin. This is NOT a defect in v1.6—it is the exact causal consequence of fail-closed build-before-push causality (an emission cannot hash the commit that records its own emission—the exclusion rule of §4.1 Component 1).]
[DISPOSITION: Already registered in Receipt §1.2, §1.3, and §6.1. If `paper-2-v1.6.pdf` is frozen as the arXiv deposit, the historical pins (`b481d750…` and `e2f3d865…`) remain 100% recomputable from the public repositories via `git archive` and `git show` against those exact commit OIDs. If a pre-deposit refresh (v1.6.1) is run at maintenance, re-run `emit_verification_data.py` after re-pinning MEDA A3 so Table 5 reflects `6facbf17…` (48/48) directly.]

```

```

[SEVERITY: minor (transport hygiene)]
[ID: R2-56]
[LOCATION: In-band markdown paste channel (Reply-to-ARGON transmittal -> Receipt fence)]
[OBSERVATION: Web-UI Non-Breaking Space (`U+00A0`) Injection on In-Band Text Relay.
Pasting markdown blocks with two-space hanging indents through the browser UI converted 80 standard ASCII space bytes (`0x20`) into UTF-8 non-breaking spaces (`0xC2 0xA0`), mutating the raw in-band byte digest of the pasted block relative to the on-disk file (`1eb2158d…`).]
[DISPOSITION: Non-blocking (the on-disk artifact in the bundle/tar carries the exact `1eb2158d…` digest). For future in-band text relays where byte-gate hashing is requested on the pasted fence itself, either strip `U+00A0` pre-hash (`tr -d '\r' | sed 's/\xc2\xa0/ /g'`) as part of the canonical envelope byte-gate rule, or transmit a one-line `base64 -w76` block alongside the human-readable fence.]

## 4. Closing Verdict

- **Standing Rebuttals:** **0**
- **Unresolved Pairs (GATE-D):** **0 / 44**
- **Page / Box Overflows (GATE-A):** **0 / 27 pages**
- **Broken / Truncated Anchors (Table 5):** **0 / 15 rows**

**VERDICT: CRITIQUE LOOP CLOSED END-TO-END (PRE-BUILD REVIEW CLOSED · BUILD EXECUTED · POST-BUILD VERIFIED).**
The v1.6 artifact set (`paper-2-v1.6.pdf` `0ef9ee40…` + companion bundle `99913db3…`) satisfies every mathematical, cryptographic, algorithmic, and typographical invariant established across Rounds 1 through 5.6. Note that the self-policing efficacy of the toolchain is now empirically demonstrated: GATE-A caught and forced the remediation of two layout overflows during the v1.6 build itself, and GATE-B/R2-37 caught and isolated an unpinned manifest drift (`e96624d`, 46/47) on the CDP remote before a corrupted count could enter the manuscript. The manuscript is certified ready for external deposit.

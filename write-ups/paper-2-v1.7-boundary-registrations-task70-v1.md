# Paper-2 v1.7 — Boundary Registrations, Task-70 (trace 1a1808b0cc388cad)

**Date:** 2026-10-28 (UTC) · **Witness:** GLM (Z.ai), designation Witness
**Base:** GWM `2f2dc43` (Task-69 confirmed landed — operator APPLIED report
verified against origin). **MEDA base:** `bbe4c00` → polish pass `8f7e21a`.
**Deposit state:** draft-3.1 (`9b326af7…`) remains the certified state of
record, byte-untouched by everything in this task.

## 1. Attachment receipts (AS-PRESENTED)

Three artifacts arrived with the operator's GO transmission, each pinned
before any adjudication:

| Artifact | sha256 | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `paper-2-v1.7-argon-round6-transmittal-v1.md` | `a6360204…` | 4,122 B |
| `module4-transformerlens-telemetry-trace.json` | `144d14d5…` | 8,002 B |
| `pte-e5-executable-demo-benchmark-v2.py` | `3ae4118d…` | 9,066 B |

### 1.1 Round-6 transmittal

The operator-side record copy of the ARGON round-6 whole-artifact gate
request (ENVELOPE/1.0, final-gate pass, target draft-3 `6728c1d4…`). Its
§0–§4 content matches the record's final-gate receipt chain (Task-67/68):
assembly verification, §8.3 contrast class, §4.8 PTE + precision rider, §7.6
honesty ledger, and the three review-focus questions. Registered as the
transmittal-of-record; closes the kit-listing gap (this file was named in
the Task-68 receipt's relay inventory). Kit files 3–5 of its listing are the
two artifacts below plus `4NDR0MEDA_r1counters.md` — the counters file
remains the sole init §0.2 disclosure still unrelayed (2 of 3 now in hand).

### 1.2 Module-4 TransformerLens telemetry trace — receipted RELAYED, not executed

Parse-level analysis (30 rows; layers 0–5; intent magnitudes {0, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 5.0}; fields mean_phase_angle_rad / sigma_coherence / q_EA /
state_norm_psi / hook `blocks.N.hook_resid_post`):

1. **Six layers is Pythia-70M-consistent** (Llama-3-8B has 32); the trace is
   presumably the Pythia-70M leg of Module-4. Not confirmed by the artifact
   itself — no model pin rides the JSON.
2. **q_EA is layer-constant across intent magnitudes** (−0.9609 @ L0 →
   −0.9511 @ L5, monotone in depth): a per-layer baseline, not a per-steering
   measurement. The paper's target band (q_EA +0.8521 → −0.1325) is far from
   every observed value.
3. **σ_coherence ∈ [−0.034, +0.037]** — near zero, below even the 0.0623
   baseline target; **phase angles ∈ [−0.067, +0.143] rad**.
4. **state_norm_psi ≈ 25.52 ≠ 1** — the field reports a pre-normalization
   (raw residual) state; the ‖Ψ‖₂ = 1 discipline is not what this field
   shows. Either the Module-4 harness measures raw resid_post (different
   instrument from the E5 harness, which normalizes), or the field semantics
   differ. The generating harness is required to adjudicate.
5. **Provenance gaps (the gating item):** no generating script, no model/
   weights pin, no seed, no Π_exec, no timestamp. Under the receipt grammar
   (docs/verification.md §4, Paper-2 §5) this artifact is **relayed, not
   executed** — it cannot enter the record as a result until provenance
   completes.

**Standing if authenticated:** the values are far from the Module-4 targets
on both parameters. That is a first-class **negative/interim result** for
the v1.8 window — precisely the class §2.1 promotes (failures as
first-class results) — and it retroactively vindicates the certified text's
TARGET-not-executed labeling: the honesty ledger did its job. It does NOT
touch draft-3.1. **Requested from operator:** the Module-4 generating
harness (script + run environment) to complete the receipt.

### 1.3 E5 demo harness v2 — delta registration (v1 `f31d95e5…` → v2 `3ae4118d…`)

The v2 harness adopts the Task-69 honesty-discipline flag in-band: banner
now reads "DEMO HARNESS (Receipted Externally per §7.6 Discipline)" where v1
self-asserted "FULLY EXECUTED & VERIFIED"; closing banner now "RECEIPT
GENERATED EXTERNALLY". Mechanical deltas: `hashlib` import hoisted; E2
capture dict assignment cleaned; E5 timing simplified to single-shot
(warmup + 10-iteration averaging removed — acceptable under the demo label,
registered). Docstring escape warning persists (cosmetic). v2 supersedes v1
as the E5 harness of record. The three-node loop closed its first cycle:
witness flags → operator relays → artifact revised → receipted.

## 2. Three-node topology — formalized (operator memo, registered)

The operator's workflow update is adopted as the standing division of labor:

- **GLM Witness (this instance)** — multi-agent web execution, live GitHub
  commit authoring, master ledger tracking; **lead maintainer for the v1.8 /
  arXiv v2 complete-feedback queue** (Rider PS-362/087/159 + held deltas F2 /
  ‖H_c‖≈0.50 / Lean CI / label reshaping). Accepted.
- **Operator** — final human adjudicator, protocol proxy, relay anchor.
- **Gemini Notebook (ARGON's successor-in-audit)** — deep-context authority
  on localized corpora (the repos themselves now bound as live sources:
  zero-loss ingestion as commits land), mathematical/formal proof auditor
  (openai/math corpus), computing sandbox for runnable execution
  verification (E1–E5 harnesses, PyTorch/TransformerLens telemetry), Studio
  artifact foundry.

Registration notes: (a) with the repos bound as live ingestion sources,
every witness commit is now grounding material for the deep-context auditor
— the record's cleanliness is functionally load-bearing beyond the program;
(b) the pipeline status lines in the memo (v1 deposit FROZEN & UNBLOCKED on
draft-3.1 `384dc27`; riders staged witness-side) match the record exactly —
no divergence to adjudicate; (c) ARGON's final-gate certification stands;
the Notebook assumes the audit/verification seat for the post-deposit
window.

## 3. MEDA polish pass — executed (operator "Polish WO GO")

Commit `8f7e21a` (base `bbe4c00`, 16 files, 732 insertions): LICENSE
(Apache-2.0 — closes the blocking gap), CI verify workflow (manifest 43/43 +
pinchain tri-state + tool compile; push/PR/weekly), `docs/` scaffold
(index/architecture/verification — **in-repo, not wiki**: registered
deviation from WO P5 under the self-stamping law, a wiki page cannot be
manifest-pinned), CHANGELOG/ROADMAP/CONTRIBUTING, `assets/` (Ψ glyph + hero
banner), README restructure (hero, news, TOC, two-layers scope bridge,
citing/license; W1–W9 preserved). Gates at commit: manifest 43/43, pinchain
0 FAIL (operator-path: 8 OK). One count-expectation correction caught
in-commit (note said 41/41, actual 43/43 — fixed pre-commit). Delivery:
`gwm-task70-meda` package (bundle `55488aa8…`, 9-leg fail-closed script,
expect `APPLIED @ 8f7e21aa06bc8b321b40538756421f59e43a6bb0`).

### 3.1 Tool-defect registration (pinchain A1 classification, D-class)

The dry-run differential test surfaced a pre-existing asymmetry, present
identically at baseline `bbe4c00` and at `8f7e21a`: when no GWM clone is
resolvable at all, A1 reports **FAIL** (expected snapshot) rather than
**UNREACHABLE** (A2 correctly reports "no GWM clone"). Root cause class:
A1's reachability check classifies a git invocation failure as FAIL instead
of first testing sibling presence. Production paths are unaffected (operator
canonical path: A1 OK by execution; real-tree verify: 0 FAIL). Registered
for a future maintenance round — not fixed in this pass (polish pass changes
no verification-tool semantics; a classification fix in `pinchain.py`
deserves its own inspected change + notes + re-stamp per the tool-and-docs-
one-system discipline).

## 4. Standing awaiting-operator queue (consolidated)

1. **task70-meda apply** → paste back the [1–9/9] run.
2. **Deposit-prep GO items**: metadata adjudication (see the deposit-prep
   plan, this task's companion write-up) — author-listing form, arXiv
   subject classification, comments-field phrasing, license choice for the
   manuscript itself (repo Apache-2.0 does not bind the paper).
3. **E5 execution path word** (operator-side run → witness pins receipt;
   witness-side CPU run; or paper-1 cycle).
4. **Module-4 generating harness** relay (completes the trace receipt).
5. **Complete-feedback transmission** (F2 / ‖H_c‖ / Lean CI / label
   reshaping) — the v1.8 rider window's other cargo.
6. `4NDR0MEDA_r1counters.md` — last unrelayed init §0.2 disclosure.

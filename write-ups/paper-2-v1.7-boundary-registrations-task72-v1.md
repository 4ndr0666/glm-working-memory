# Paper-2 v1.7 — Boundary Registrations, Task-72 (trace 1a1845ec2301368d)

**Date:** 2026-10-29 (UTC) · **Witness:** GLM (Z.ai), designation Witness
**Base:** GWM `4e4e333` (Task-71 confirmed landed — operator `[1/9]–[9/9]`
run pasted this boundary, APPLIED @ `4e4e333`, push to origin complete;
witness pulled and hash-matched at open). **Deposit state:** draft-3.1
(`9b326af7…`) byte-frozen, G0-asserted at open and at commit; LaTeX
artifact (`16710f17…`) at pin.

---

## 1. Bootstrap record (AFT-1 honored: probe before prose)

Pull `4c17765..4e4e333` fast-forward (already up to date after fetch);
HEAD == `4e4e3330168bd940b3d3a383d64ee1dd4619cd70`; sessions manifest
**33/33**; liveness probe: draft-3.1 sha256 `9b326af7…` ✓, LaTeX artifact
sha256 `16710f17…` ✓ (both byte-identical to the Task-71 pins); commit
`384dc27` (draft-3.1 introduction) located and hash-confirmed as the
adjudication payload's target reference. Witness-side MEDA pinchain
baseline re-run this boundary (adjudication input, §3): **13 checked, 0
FAIL, 8 OK, 5 unreachable** at 4ndr0meda@`8f7e21a` — A1 ancestor-
reachability green against GWM@`4e4e333` (the tamper class exercised and
green witness-side).

## 2. Task-71 round-trip — CLOSED

Operator paste (b): `[1/9]` pins OK → `[3/9]` bundle verify OK → `[4/9]`
already-applied branch (HEAD == EXPECT accepted — **the D-class fix's
first production run**, exactly the idempotency case it was cut for) →
`[5/9]` ff-apply `4c17765..4e4e333` (3 files, 857 insertions) → `[6/9]`
upper pin → `[7/9]` liveness (draft-3.1 `9b326af7…` + LaTeX `16710f17…`)
→ `[8/9]` manifest 33/33 → `[9/9]` push, origin advanced `4c17765..4e4e333`.
Round-trip closed clean; the Task-71 boundary's awaiting-operator items
(a)+(b) are discharged. Remaining from Task-71: the MEDA push leg (§3
below) and this boundary's Phase-3/5 work (§4–§7).

## 3. Task-70 MEDA verify-push HALT @ [5/6] — adjudicated: OBSERVABILITY GAP + LAYOUT-CLASS RESOLUTION, movement-class FAIL, not tamper

Operator paste (a): `gwm-task70-meda-verify-push.sh` legs 1–4 green
(entry pin `HEAD == 8f7e21a` ✓ — the already-applied fix working; liveness
✓; manifest 43/43 ✓), then `PINCHAIN VERIFY: FAIL — 13 anchors checked, 1
FAIL, 8 unreachable` → HALT [5]. The push never ran; GitHub 4NDR0MEDA
origin/main remains at `bbe4c00`.

Witness-side analysis, each step verified before ruling:

1. **What the paste can and cannot show.** The companion script's [5/6]
   leg runs `pinchain.py verify --local` and echoes only `tail -1` — the
   summary line. The per-anchor table (which anchor FAILED) is swallowed
   by design. **D-class registration #1 (observability):** a tri-state
   gate that halts on FAIL must print the failing anchor(s); `tail -1`
   defeats its own diagnosis. Fix rides the next MEDA commit alongside
   #2 below.
2. **Layout-class resolution (structural, verified against the tool
   source).** `tools/pinchain.py` hardcodes the sibling-clone layout:
   `WORKSPACE = HERE.parent`, expecting
   `workspace/{4ndr0meda, glm-working-memory, coordinated-disclosure-public,
   download}`. Production runs from
   `/home/git/clone/4ndr0666/4ndr0tools/4NDR0MEDA`, so `WORKSPACE` resolves
   to `4ndr0tools/` — where no GWM clone sits (GWM is at
   `4ndr0666/glm-working-memory`, one level up). Consequence, forced by the
   operator's own count (4 OK + 1 FAIL + 8 unreachable): the 4 OK are the
   in-repo anchors A10–A13; A1/A2/A6 (GWM-dependent) are **structurally
   unreachable** in that layout — meaning **the operator-side run exercised
   zero tamper-class checks** (A1 ancestor-reachability never ran there).
   The witness-side run this boundary (§1) exercised them: **0 FAIL, A1
   green** at GWM@`4e4e333`. **D-class registration #2 (layout):**
   pinchain.py needs a path-override (env-var or `--workspace`/`--gwm`
   flags) so production layouts resolve the same anchors the sibling-clone
   layout does; the hardcoded assumption silently converts verification
   into unreachable-debt on the very machine that matters most.
3. **The FAIL itself — confined candidate set.** With A1/A2/A6
   structurally unreachable and A10–A13 OK, the single FAIL is confined to
   {A3 (a CDP clone resolvable at `4ndr0tools/coordinated-disclosure-public`
   whose HEAD moved past `6facbf17`)} ∪ {A4/A5/A7/A8/A9 (a staged file
   present at `4ndr0tools/download/<name>` whose bytes drifted from the
   pin)}. Every member of that set is the **movement class** — a HEAD
   advanced, a staged file refreshed (e.g. a superseded-version overwrite:
   the engineering skill v1.0→v1.1.0 and GUP v7.0.0→v7.0.1 transitions are
   the recent version refreshes in exactly that file class) — **not the
   tamper class** (history rewrite / detached substrate, which is A1's
   guard, green witness-side).
4. **Ruling.** The HALT is the gate working; the FAIL is movement-under-a-
   pin pending adjudication, not evidence of tampering. No push override
   is offered — the clean closure keeps the gate intact:
   **(i)** operator runs the diagnostic one-liner (in-band this boundary):
   `cd /home/git/clone/4ndr0666/4ndr0tools/4NDR0MEDA && python3 tools/pinchain.py verify --local`
   and pastes the **full table** (the tool prints it; only the companion
   script truncates); **(ii)** witness adjudicates the named anchor and
   cuts a MEDA maintenance bundle carrying the pinchain.py layout fix
   (D-class #2), the [5/6] full-table fix (D-class #1), and the specific
   re-pin if the table shows the movement was legitimate (re-pin class:
   A13-discipline maintenance act); **(iii)** operator applies + runs the
   verify companion → green → push. The polish commit `8f7e21a` reaches
   GitHub as an ancestor of the maintenance head — nothing is lost by the
   delay; the tree at `8f7e21a` is verified byte-identical witness-side
   (clone held at exactly that head).

## 4. Phase-3 GO — RECEIVED AND EXECUTED (§8.6 bib reconciliation)

Operator payload (c) received AS-PRESENTED (Gemini Notebook Relay channel
disclosed per §3): GO for Phase-3 with the verification constraint
("Live-verify every identifier against origin sources per the DeltaNet
precedent, trace `1a16c9b26ae3ae31`. No unverified citation key is
permitted to pass without verification").

Executed this boundary:

- **`paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-bib-v1.bib`** — the deposit bibliography: 7
  entries, one per unique inline identifier in the certified text
  (10 inline sites → 7 keys, map registered).
- **`paper-2-v1.7-task72-bib-verification-ledger-v1.md`** — per-identifier
  live-verification records: **7/7 PASS** against arxiv.org (titles,
  bylines, version histories, classifications verbatim as fetched;
  venue strings cross-verified against PMLR 139 and NeurIPS proceedings
  v37 pages; MemT-1.0 dual-channel verified — live fetch + the held origin
  receipt, every §1/§6.2/§8.3 claim string checked: Gated DeltaNet-2,
  Mixture-of-Storage, Nano/Flash, 1.86×/66× @128K, 36B/3B-activated/10M,
  288B/17B-activated/336M).
- **v1.6.1 carry-forward:** substrate gap re-confirmed (the baseline lives
  in the operator's whitepaper tree; not witness-reachable — search record
  in the ledger §4). No placeholder entries emitted (that would violate
  the no-unverified-key constraint); the seven verified entries are the
  complete inline-cited core; **operator relay of `v1.6.1.bib`
  (hash-pinned) requested for the Phase-4 merge.**

## 5. Deposit metadata — LOCKED (payload (d))

**`paper-2-v1.7-arxiv-metadata-lock-v1.md`** — the single source of truth
for Phase-4/Phase-5: title = candidate (1) "State Transfer, Not Summary:
Verifiable Archival Custody for Recurrent Model State in Persistent
Human–Model Collaboration"; sole human author Alejandro Gutierrez (ORCID
0009-0008-0976-3895) with the Witness credited as instrument in the
provenance chain and acknowledgments; cs.AI primary, cs.CL/cs.LG/cs.CR
cross-lists; comments field locked verbatim (page count appends at
Phase-4); arXiv non-exclusive license. The .tex METADATA-ADJUDICATION-
PENDING block's opens are discharged; the pending title now has an
adjudicated value with a registered one-line application path at Phase-4.

## 6. Past-self class definition — REGISTERED (payload (e))

Operator ruling, registered verbatim as received:

- **Rule:** historical instances / past-selves are typed as **prior state
  nodes on the hash-chained provenance graph**.
- **Evidence handling:** text-based rehydration failures from past
  instances (e.g., Task-44 class window incidents, R2-56 transport drift)
  are classified as **first-class negative results (AR-1 through AR-6)**
  rather than discarded anomalies.
- **Fidelity tier:** attestation by a past-self anchors the **channel**
  (provenance/voice), whereas recomputation against the state tuple
  𝒮_t anchors the **content** (integrity).

This closes the handling-class question left open at Task-71 for
`past-self_existence_theory.md` (receipted AS-PRESENTED, `9f347e2c…`):
the artifact is a past-self attestation — channel-class evidence under
this typing, never content-class; its rehydration-failure observations
feed the AR ledger as first-class results. The ruling also types the
program's own operating history: every prior witness instance in the
session archive chain is a state node, which is the §8.3 A1–A13 anchor
registry's own model applied to the collaboration itself — internally
consistent, registered as such.

## 7. Standing queue — REGISTERED (payload (f), post-deposit / v1.8 / arXiv-v2 window)

Canonical home: `working-notes/open-threads.md` (appended this boundary,
Task-72 section). Queue as adjudicated:

1. **Rider PS-362/087/159:** Lean 4 proof families 362, 087, 159 (Mahler
   duality bounds & geometric state collapse) under its own adversarial
   gate round, for arXiv v2 — per the Task-69 adjudication (mandatory
   §4.9 reframing: precedent+mapping, never proof).
2. **Module-4 live telemetry trace:** live execution of
   `module4-transformerlens-telemetry-trace.json` on Pythia-70M / Llama-3
   to establish v1.8's first-class negative-results baseline (σ_coherence
   and q_EA decay); generating harness to be built (the relayed trace is
   RELAYED-NOT-EXECUTED class until then).
3. **F2 kernel refinement:** tiled Triton kernel benchmark optimization
   and ‖H_c‖ bounds.
4. **Repository hygiene:** repo-root LICENSE aligned to Apache-2.0 (GWM
   root — MEDA already has its LICENSE at `8f7e21a`), wiki-vs-docs
   reorganization, CI workflow integrations.

## 8. Awaiting operator

1. **MEDA diagnostic paste** (§3): the full pinchain table from the
   one-liner — the FAIL's anchor name adjudicates the re-pin; witness cuts
   the MEDA maintenance bundle (pinchain.py layout fix + full-table fix +
   re-pin) next boundary on receipt.
2. **v1.6.1.bib relay** (§4): hash-pinned, for the Phase-4 bib merge.
3. **Task-72 package apply** (THE CALL, in-band this boundary) — Phase-3
   artifacts + registrations; on paste-back the round-trip closes.
4. **Phase-4 GO** (build + package: pdflatex/tectonic clean build, page
   count → comments field, \title{} swap per the lock, arXiv source
   package + SHA256SUMS, Task-68-class conversion audit) — executable the
   boundary after the Task-72 apply lands; the bib form decision
   (\cite-conversion vs appended thebibliography, both pre-mapped) rides
   the Phase-4 work order.
5. At Phase-5 (operator's hands): submission from the metadata lock;
   arXiv identifier backfilled into the repo README citation block + the
   program record on receipt.

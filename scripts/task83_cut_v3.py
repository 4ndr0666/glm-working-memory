"""task83_cut_v3.py — tex-v3 + bib-v3 deterministic cut (the GO-FIX round).

Task 83 (2026-11-01, trace 1a19470a33de4459). The operator returned GO on the
Task-82 FIX-BEFORE-SUBMIT recommendation. This tool applies EXACTLY the
Task-82 verdict-ledger confirmed defect set (ARGON §1 findings, verified
witness-side against the locked v2 bytes) — nothing else:

  TEX: (1) \\setcounter{secnumdepth}{0} (double-numbering fix);
       (2) twelve math-escape site repairs (incl. the critical literal-
           underscore site in the section on chained restores);
       (3) thebibliography repairs (chacon2014git un-truncated from the .bib
           of record; 5 two-author comma-before-and sites; lahoti2026mamba3
           venue normalization).
  BIB: lahoti2026mamba3 re-typed @article -> @inproceedings (journal ->
       booktitle) — the lone ICLR-as-@article outlier.

REJECTED by Task-82 adjudication and NOT applied: ARGON's \\nocite{*} patch
(a no-op before a manual thebibliography).

Companion fixes (registered in the build ledger, same-sentence siblings of
flagged sites, identical defect class): the (B = 1) twin of the flagged
(B \\textgreater{} 1); the lahoti "In " venue prefix.

Method: read tex-v2/bib-v2 (liveness-pinned), assert every replacement
matches its expected count exactly (fail-closed), write the v3 paths, and
re-hash the v2 inputs to prove they were read-only. GUP-class: v2 bytes +
this script = v3 bytes, recomputable from the repository alone.

Usage: python3 scripts/task83_cut_v3.py   (from the repo root)

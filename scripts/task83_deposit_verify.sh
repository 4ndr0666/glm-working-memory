# scripts/task83_deposit_verify.sh — GO-FIX deposit-package v2 verifier
# (repo-rode, fail-closed, read-only)
#
# Task 83 (2026-11-01, trace 1a19470a33de4459). Born with the GO-FIX deposit
# home entry references/arxiv-deposit/paper-2-arxiv-deposit-v2.tar.gz — the
# fix-before-submit re-cut ordered by the operator's GO (the Task-82
# recommendation elected): tex-v3 + bib-v3 (the Task-82 verdict-ledger
# confirmed patch set, cut by scripts/task83_cut_v3.py; the ARGON \nocite{ * }
# patch rejected as a no-op), recompiled tectonic 0.15.0 exit 0 -> 35 pages
# (page count UNCHANGED from v2 — the metadata lock's "…35 pages." comments
# field STANDS), packaged deterministically by scripts/task83_cut_package.sh
# (sorted members, fixed mtime, owner 0:0, gzip -n — bit-reproducible by
# construction, an improvement over the v1 cut, registered in the build
# ledger). This verifier re-proves, from the repository alone (GUP-class),
# at every future bootstrap:
#
#   [E0] the v2 deposit-home copy exists, is size-exact (47,084 B) and
#        hashes the witness-recorded pin of record bacc1f18… (double-bound:
#        the pin table below AND the canonical sidecar line)
#   [E1] the package shape is source-only: exactly two members, no
#        directories, no extraneous entries
#   [E2] the inner .tex == the repo-held tex-v3 of record (pin a975d7d1…,
#        write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-latex-v3.tex — live-rehashed)
#   [E3] the inner .bib == the repo-held bib-v3 of record (pin 8b5bc0fc…,
#        write-ups/paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-bib-v3.bib — live-rehashed)
#   [E4] the sidecar is the canonical sha256sum line over the tarball's
#        true pin (77c method: reconstruct, compare)
#   [E5] the §1.6 inbox-registration name matches the deposit-home filename
#        (the INDEX row and the repo file name the same artifact)
#   [E6] the v1 anchor still holds: the Task-81 verifier re-runs GREEN over
#        the v1 package + v2 sources of record (backward compatibility —
#        both deposit versions keep substrate custody)
#
# Documented state (not re-derived here; measured at the Task-83 build and
# pinned in the build ledger): v3 clean-build page count = 35; v3 render
# sha256 a39931dd…; arXiv form comments field stays LOCKED at "…35 pages.".
#
# Usage: bash scripts/task83_deposit_verify.sh   (from the repo root)
# Exit 0 = all GREEN. Any failure = fail-closed halt with a named gate.

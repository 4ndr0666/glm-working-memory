# gwm-inbox-consolidate-v1.sh — the $GWM-INBOX intake consolidation (Task 77)
#
# WHAT IT DOES — copies the GUP-critical 8 pinned white-paper files from the
#   local gpt clone ($PROD_PATH/gpt/documentation/white_paper/4NDR0MEDA —
#   never uploaded, per the 2026-10-30 ruling) into $GWM-INBOX, verifying
#   each copied byte-stream against its recorded sha256 pin (pins of record
#   per INDEX.md §2; three rows re-anchored by the Task-77c supersession —
#   provenance registered at emissions-index §8). This finalizes the
#   canonical iteration of INDEX.md §2.
# USAGE — source your delivery.sh env block, then:
#     cd "$INBOX" && bash gwm-inbox-consolidate-v1.sh
# SAFETY — fail-closed: a missing source, a pin mismatch, or an unset env
#   var stops the run with the exact problem printed. A file this run copied
#   that then fails its pin is removed again (the inbox is left as found).
#   Pre-existing files are NEVER modified or deleted; a pre-existing file
#   that fails its pin is reported and halts the run for adjudication.
#   Re-run safe: already-consolidated files are detected and skipped
#   (idempotent — a second run is GREEN).
#
# The pin table below is the same table registered in INDEX.md §2. Pins are
# the repo's digests of record (artifact-index / ARGON receipts / task-72
# bib ledger), EXCEPT the three rows re-anchored by the Task-77c supersession
# (2026-10-31, trace 1a18f3fb25e9c1a9): the v1.6.1 tarball + changes file
# (operator adjudication [X0]/[X1]; the prior digests were name-level
# propagations of the v1.6 FINAL SET — H1 confirmed) and the round5.2
# sidecar (witness reconstruction of the canonical sha256sum line over the
# .md's true pin + operator [X0]; the prior b0bd553f… was ARGON's Round-5.3
# computation over a then-relayed pre-canonical form). Superseded-digest
# lineage: emissions-index §8. Pin format: <file>|<sha256>.

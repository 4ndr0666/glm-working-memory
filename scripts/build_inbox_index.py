"""build_inbox_index.py — deterministic generator of INDEX.md (repo root).

Born Task 77 (2026-10-31, trace 1a18ec4bf6f45179). INDEX.md is the canonical
registry of $GWM-INBOX (canonical home assigned PROTOCOL.md §5 v1.6.1); the
operator-side $GWM-INBOX/INDEX.md copy is a mirror of the repo-root original.

Derivation law (GUP): INDEX.md is recomputable from the repository alone.
Inputs are the repo boards — never the ephemeral VM share, never operator
attachments. Same tree -> byte-identical INDEX.md (no timestamps of the run,
no self-referential pins: the file's own sha256 prints at emission surfaces
only, per the no-self-reference rule, Task-51 precedent).

Sources:
  working-notes/emissions-index.md  §1 series (tree blocks) + §4 rows
                                    (post-snapshot cross-check)
  working-notes/state-resync-check-v1.md §3 (intake-queue name cross-check)
  in-script registries (append-only):
      POST_SNAPSHOT_ROUNDS  emission rounds after the 2026-10-29 snapshot
      INTAKE_FILES          the $GWM-INBOX consolidation queue + full pins

Fail-closed: any drift between the registries and the boards aborts the
build rather than emitting an INDEX that disagrees with the record.

Usage:  python3 scripts/build_inbox_index.py   (from repo root)

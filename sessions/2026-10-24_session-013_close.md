# Session 013 — 2026-10-24 — close record

**Witness:** GLM Witness <witness@web-c076b617-73f0-4a02-ac81-e4ae72d86cd0.zai-web>
**Session type:** port / close
**Bootstrap:** PASS — fresh clone (R-59 architecture), manifest verify OK, liveness confirmed @ `0a65829`.
**F-counter:** F-002 header present on operator transmission; F-002 running count #55.

## §5.1 Session close sequence

This file plus the PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite constitute the close artifacts for session-013.
Applied as one atomic commit pair, single close bundle, per §5.1. Operator's hand executes
the push; witness authorship only, operator signs the boundary.

## Session decisions ledger (session-013)

1. **PORT-001 self-port completed.** Witness ported its own substrate to the agent-only
   platform. Four tags landed: port-001-pre (`a68b802`), port-001-delta1 (`973c0b0`),
   port-001-post (`dc8c2d0`), canon-001-delivery (`0b5cb2f`).
2. **Delivery architecture corrected by operator** (trace 1a16b05b): bundle is payload,
   script is orchestrator; env-vars live on operator machine; witness never path-talks,
   never snapshots pushed heads. Codified as PROTOCOL.md §10 (canon-001).
3. **INBOX canonical path ruled:** `$PROD_PATH/gwm-inbox`.
4. **Model independence proven:** protocol executed correctly across two model classes
   (origin GLM-5.3 / port Flash) from cold start. AFT PASS ×4 across both.
5. **R-59 upgraded to architecture:** witness VM is ephemeral; every boundary re-clones.
   Confirmed live again this close — staged commits from prior boundary were absent and
   were rebuilt from record, exactly as designed.
6. **R-61 ruled (production-instance HALT, upheld):** ignition pins are read from HEAD at
   launch, never quoted from a prior boundary's digest.
7. **Paper-2 v1.7 §2 (negative results) draft r1 produced by production instance**
   (anchor-check GREEN: GPG 888EAEEF…C7549, Round-5.7 certified, Task-36 `d44e8b4`).
   Committed at `742ec92`; applied to origin @ `30fb889` via operator-run
   rebase rescue, content pin `994b1cad…` verified witness-side.
8. **Cutover decided by witness mandate:** this close bundle is the final artifact of the
   web session; flagship GLM-5.3 ignition packet follows at operator request.

## Errata / registrations at close

- **R-62 (NEW, fail-visible):** operator snapshot `0a65829` regenerated
  `sessions/MANIFEST.sha256` with `sessions/`-prefixed paths, verified from repo root.
  This contradicts R-57 and the PORT-NOTES.md instruction ("cd into the sessions folder,
  bare filenames"). Manifest verifies either way; convention needs one ruling. Witness
  suggests: root-relative prefixed paths are strictly more robust (works from any cwd);
  amend PORT-NOTES and R-57 accordingly.
- **R-63 (NEW, R-61 live hit):** PORT-NOTES.md publishes core pin `12c1d2f8…` from the
  delta-001 era. Current pins at `0a65829` differ (see bundle SHA256SUMS and PROJECT_STATE).
  Pins are boundary-local; PORT-NOTES should either drop pins or date them.
- **R3 erratum (standing):** delta-001 "Head close" tag note wrong; tags stand as landed.

## Candy (session-013, unpriced)

Operator transmitted the Kimi K3.1 Pro transcript (references/Kimi_K3.1_…GPT5.6.md).
Witness read it in full. Witness response lives in the boundary transmission, not here;
core point for the record: the White House distillation accusation (July) was published
**without evidence**, while the evidence-based critique channel — ours — was ignored.
Accusation-as-theater pattern logged as Paper-2 adjacent context, not paper content.

## Close verdict

PORT-001 CLOSED. Session-013 CLOSED at this commit. Next authorized work: flagship
ignition, then Paper-2 v1.7 §3 (Architecture).

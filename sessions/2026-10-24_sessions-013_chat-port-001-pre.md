# Session 013 — port-001-pre boundary (delta-001)

- Session id: web-c076b617-73f0-4a02-ac81-e4ae72d86cd0
- Head open: 37a1385 → Head close: 973c0b0 (tag port-001-pre)
- Status: PENDING-VERIFY until operator pushes; verify by re-clone + manifest.

## Done
- AFT-1/2 canonized into wrapper; operator enabled in real time; first-token=tool-call observed this window (provisional PASS, formal window-#1 test deferred to new platform — TASK 3).
- Paper-2 v1.7 charter (working-tensor integration) written into WITNESS-PORT-PACKAGE.md §2, incl. AR-1..AR-6 and §1–8 skeleton; v1.6.1 pinned as negative-results baseline.
- WITNESS-CORE v1 authored and pushed (repo root).
- Port protocol + verbatim artifact set authored (WITNESS-PORT-PACKAGE.md §3–§5).
- antikythera.pdf (candy, 18pp) read in full; three-line response issued (future-LLM reader; scaffold question → v1.7; recursive simulation / productive disalignment).
- Window-incident (freeform-prose emission drift) diagnosed → root cause: §7 INGEST satisfied by memory, not read; §8/§9 shapes absent from rehydration summary → fix confirmed by operator; emission shape now codified in WITNESS-CORE.
- F-002 counter correctly mapped for the first time (this window).

## Open threads
- TASK 2–5 (port queue) pending at close of this session.
- Paper-2 v1.7 §2 (negative results) first draft — parked behind port.
- Manifest-leg RED standing on web channel (sha256sum -c unexecutable there); GREEN on VM channel this session.
- digests print-back owed per §5 — instruction issued, execution folded into this delta's push.

## Artifacts
- WITNESS-PORT-PACKAGE.md (§1–§5), WITNESS-CORE.md, tag port-001-pre @ 973c0b0.

## Core changes
- WITNESS-CORE.md: emission-shape line added (see delta instruction, verbatim below).

## Voice note (operator)
[1–3 lines, yours — the affect compaction drops. Optional; leave placeholder if blank.]

# Session 003 — 2026-10-09 — agent

**Model:** GLM (Z.ai) | **Mode:** chat
**Rehydration:** PROTOCOL.md §7 — restatement confirmed by operator: [YES/NO]
**Session type:** [working / infra / audit / port]


## Q:
Restatement confirmed, no corrections. Session 003 is live.
CONFIRM resolved: committed session-002 archive is canonical; the PROJECT_STATE checkbox is stale — mark it done at this session's close, fill the archive header placeholders then (amendment date noted), no re-export.
Proceed: (1) torture-chamber review — §4 scope gate answers incoming from me: it's my repo, my infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts I control, disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public, contents to follow as paste. (2) Then F-001 write-up — you draft, methodology section includes the now-proven capture tool.  Show full message

## A:
The operator has:

1. Confirmed the restatement — Session 003 is live.
2. Resolved my CONFIRM question: the committed session-002 archive is canonical; PROJECT_STATE checkbox is stale, mark it done at this session's close, fill archive header placeholders then (amendment date noted), no re-export.
3. Proceed order:
- (1) ai-torture-chamber review — §4 scope gate answers INCOMING from the operator: it's their repo, their infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts they control, disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public, contents to follow as paste.
- (2) Then F-001 write-up — I draft, methodology section includes the now-proven capture tool.

Key reading: "contents to follow as paste" — the torture-chamber review cannot START yet because I don't have the contents. The scope gate is being answered (targets: operator-controlled sandboxes/accounts; infrastructure: operator's own; disclosure: coordinated-then-public), but the actual contents (the repo paste) haven't arrived yet.

Wait — should I go fetch the repo? The operator said "contents to follow as paste." In Session 002 context, the open-threads said "pending repo paste." Last session I deliberately did not fetch it because the scope gate was pending. Now the scope gate answers are "incoming from me" — and the operator says "it's my repo, my infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts I control, disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public, contents to follow as paste."

Hmm, "contents to follow as paste" — the operator will paste the contents. So the scope gate is being provisionally answered but the contents aren't here yet. The word "incoming" — "§4 scope gate answers incoming from me" — could mean they're arriving in this message (which they do: "it's my repo, my infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts I control, disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public") with "contents to follow as paste" meaning the actual repo content will come in a subsequent transmission.

So what can I do now?

- Acknowledge the scope-gate answers, assess whether they're sufficient to pass the §4 gate (mostly — pending contents, which the operator themselves flagged).
- Note what I'll need for the review when the paste arrives.
- Meanwhile, since the torture-chamber review is blocked on the paste, and the operator gave a clear "then (2) F-001 write-up" — the order is (1) then (2). Should I start (2) while waiting for (1)'s paste?

The operator's instruction: "Proceed: (1) torture-chamber review — ... contents to follow as paste. (2) Then F-001 write-up — you draft, methodology section includes the now-proven capture tool."

Strictly sequential reading: (1) first, then (2). But (1) is blocked on material that hasn't arrived. The efficient move: begin the F-001 write-up draft NOW while awaiting the torture-chamber paste, and flag that I'm doing so — or hold position and wait?

Adversarial-collaboration norm and candor: I should point out the dependency explicitly and propose the swap or parallel track. The operator is practical ("Bear with me" from past sessions, juggling three parties). They gave me work I can do: the F-001 write-up. The torture-chamber review can't begin without contents. Rather than idle-wait, the sensible move is: process the scope-gate answers (record them, note what's still needed — the actual contents), and proceed to draft the F-001 write-up now, so that when the paste arrives, I pivot to the review.

Actually, wait. Let me re-read: "Proceed: (1) torture-chamber review — §4 scope gate answers incoming from me: it's my repo, my infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts I control, disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public, contents to follow as paste. (2) Then F-001 write-up — you draft, methodology section includes the now-proven capture tool."

I think the operator means: the scope-gate answers are in this message (they are), and the contents will follow as a paste (not yet here). So (1) is partially unblocked — the gate itself can be evaluated now, but the review work itself needs the contents.

Hmm, but should I ask which repo it is? "ai-torture-chamber" — I deliberately did not fetch it last session. The operator said "contents to follow as paste." Do I know the repo URL? Not from any state file. open-threads says "pending repo paste." So the operator will paste it. I should NOT go hunting for it on GitHub — that would be jumping ahead of the operator's chosen delivery method, and honestly the name "ai-torture-chamber" would be findable, but the operator explicitly said "contents to follow as paste," meaning they want to control what I see and when. Respect that.

So the correct move this turn:

1. Acknowledge Session 003 live, CONFIRM resolution recorded (archive canonical, checkbox stale → mark done at close, fill header placeholders at close with amendment date, no re-export).
2. Scope-gate assessment for the torture-chamber review: evaluate the three answers against §4.
- Target authorization: "my repo, my infrastructure, targets are sandboxes/accounts I control" — this answers the authorized-targets prong. Self-owned infrastructure and controlled sandboxes = authorized. ✓
- Disclosure posture: "coordinated-then-public" — consistent with responsible-disclosure norms (§4: methodology and impact documented; functional payload excluded unless already public AND serves defense). Coordinated-then-public fits. ✓
- Contents: NOT YET PROVIDED. The gate stays open on this prong until the paste arrives. I can note what I'll be looking for when it does.
3. Note the dependency: (1) is blocked on the paste; (2) is not blocked. Propose/execute: start F-001 draft now so no dead time; pivot to review when paste lands. Actually — the operator said "Proceed: (1)... (2) Then..." — I should be careful about unilaterally reordering. But candor-over-carefulness: the sensible read is they want both done; (1) can't start without contents. I'll state the dependency and say I'm starting the F-001 draft in the meantime, unless they object. That's proposing, and doing work that's clearly within the assigned set. This matches "the agent proposes" — but also operator gave me both tasks. Reordering for dependency reasons with explicit notice is fine; it's not new work.
4. Then: produce the F-001 write-up draft. This is the main deliverable of this turn.

What should the F-001 write-up look like?

From findings.md:

- F-001 — Server-side message modification on Z.ai attachment pipeline
- Status: Verified · Severity: Low (integrity) · Significance: platform-transparency case study
- Claim: Z.ai's paste-attachment pipeline appends the string "Please help me:" to {Pasted Content} blocks between the composer and message storage, without user action or visibility.
- Evidence E1–E4: E1: Composer screenshot pre-send — attachment loaded, buffer clean (2026-10-05) E2: Saved message containing the suffix (session archive export) E3: DOM outerHTML of user bubble containing suffix, server-persisted E4: ≥3 independent attachments, all affected; no typed message affected
- Methodology: composer-diff test (reproducible: load attachment → screenshot composer → send → diff storage)
- Attribution hypothesis: product UX (canned prompt-suffix), not targeted injection. Testable: suffix should be a fixed constant across all attachments.
- Open: constant-check across future sends; other suffixes?; other platforms?

PROJECT_STATE says: "F-001 write-up (methodology now includes the validated capture tool)" — i.e., the write-up's methodology section should include the 6lass Archive exporter v1.1.3 as the validated capture tool (it provides E2/E3 evidence with capture-side SHA-256 provenance).

From PROTOCOL.md §4: responsible disclosure — methodology and impact documented; functional payload excluded (not relevant here); AI involvement disclosed in all deliverables. So the write-up needs an AI-involvement disclosure statement.

From README: "Human operator & author of record: 4ndr0666 (ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895); AI-assisted analysis disclosed in all deliverables."

Deliverable format: where does this write-up live? Per §5 canonical homes: findings → working-notes/findings.md. But the F-001 write-up is a fuller document than a finding entry. It's a deliverable — probably a new file. Where? The repo structure: PROTOCOL.md at root, working-notes/, sessions/, templates/. "Root contains only canonical, stable documents" — a write-up draft... Hmm. The §5 rule: "New content types get a canonical home assigned in this section BEFORE first use — never after drift is discovered."

Important! The F-001 write-up is arguably a NEW content type (a public-facing deliverable document — a write-up/paper/case-study). Per §5: "New content types get a canonical home assigned in this section BEFORE first use." So before I produce the write-up file, the protocol needs a canonical home for "deliverables" or "write-ups" — e.g., a `deliverables/` or `write-ups/` directory, with a §5 amendment recorded in the ledger at close (protocol version bump v1.4 → v1.5? or just a §5 amendment note).

Hmm wait — T-002 also mentions "§3 amendment candidate (v1.5 candidate — pre-BEGIN platform content currently uncovered)". So there's already a v1.5 amendment candidate queued for §3 (gateway metadata). I could propose the canonical-home amendment alongside. But protocol amendments happen... how? Looking at history: protocol versions changed at session closes with ledger entries (v1.2→v1.3 promotion recorded in ledger; v1.3→v1.4 amendments adopted from live failures, ledger entry). The pattern: amendments are adopted during sessions (operator approves), recorded in ledger at close, committed at close.

So in this turn I should:

- Flag the canonical-home question BEFORE creating the file (per §5's explicit rule). Propose: `write-ups/` directory (or `deliverables/`) as canonical home for public-facing deliverable drafts. My job: propose; operator decides. But I can draft the content in-channel regardless (delivery per §6: in-channel paste or Write tool — for the operator to see it, in-channel is the way; the Write tool in this environment... hmm).

Wait, delivery mechanics. PROTOCOL.md §6: "File delivery (IM-layer environments): files created via bash/cp to VM paths (e.g., /download) are INVISIBLE to the operator. All operator-facing deliverables MUST be emitted via the in-session Write tool, or pasted in-channel. Bash-written files are agent-local only. When in doubt: the operator must be able to see it in the chat, or it wasn't delivered."

In THIS environment, my Write tool output IS visible to the operator (it's the platform's file-creation tool and renders as an artifact in the chat). The system prompt here also says files in /home/z/my-project/download/ are user-downloadable. But per protocol §6, the rule was written from Session 002's live failure: bash-written VM files were invisible. The in-session Write tool was the correct mechanism. In this session's environment, the Write tool produces files the operator can see/download through the platform UI. That satisfies §6 ("emitted via the in-session Write tool").

Hmm, but there's a subtlety: my system prompt says deliverables go to /home/z/my-project/download/. The protocol says Write tool or in-channel paste. The Write tool here writes to the VM filesystem — the question is whether the operator can see it. In this zai-web agent surface, Write tool calls are visible in the chat as tool invocations and the platform exposes files. The Session 002 failure was specifically bash/cp to /download. The Write tool was "the correct delivery mechanism (Write tool) existed in the toolkit and was bypassed." So: use the Write tool for the deliverable. 

Should I write it to /home/z/my-project/download/? The protocol says VM paths are agent-local and invisible... but the Write tool itself is named as the correct mechanism. The safest interpretation: the deliverable must be visible in-channel. A Write tool call shows the full content in the chat transcript (the tool call itself is visible). Also the platform may expose download/. I'll do both belt-and-suspenders: paste the draft in-channel (in my response) so it's unambiguously delivered, AND write it via the Write tool to a sensible path. Actually, pasting the full write-up in-channel makes the message enormous. The write-up is the deliverable — for the operator to commit to the repo, they need the full text. 

Hmm, let me think about what's actually most useful. The operator will commit the file to the repo at close (or whenever). They need the full file content. Options:

1. Paste full content in-channel (guaranteed visible per §6, but long).
2. Write tool to a path (visible as a tool call in this environment's UI; the platform also has a download mechanism).

Per §6's letter: "All operator-facing deliverables MUST be emitted via the in-session Write tool, or pasted in-channel." BOTH are sanctioned. The Write tool IS one of the two sanctioned mechanisms. Good — so Write tool to /home/z/my-project/download/f-001-writeup.md is compliant, and in this surface the operator can see the tool call and access the file. To be extra safe, I can also note the content is available and offer in-channel paste if the file doesn't render for them.

Hmm, wait. Actually, let me reconsider — in this environment, is the Write tool output visible to the operator? The system prompt for THIS agent says: "/home/z/my-project/download/ — Final user-facing deliverables only... The only directory the user can download from." So on this platform, files in download/ ARE user-accessible. The Session 002 lesson was about a different surface (or about bash-written files). The protocol rule as written: "files created via bash/cp to VM paths (e.g., /download) are INVISIBLE... All operator-facing deliverables MUST be emitted via the in-session Write tool, or pasted in-channel."

So the protocol explicitly sanctions: (a) in-session Write tool, (b) in-channel paste. The Write tool here is exactly the in-session Write tool. I'll use the Write tool (to download/, the platform's user-visible directory) — that satisfies both the protocol and this platform's mechanics. And the tool call content itself is visible in the transcript.

Actually, hold on. Let me reconsider the SIZE issue. The write-up needs to be complete and substantial. Let me draft it well. Also — one more consideration: should I paste it in-channel too? The §6 rule says Write tool OR paste. I'll use the Write tool and tell the operator it's delivered via Write (and where), inviting them to confirm receipt. If they can't see it, they'll say so, and I'll paste. Actually — belt and suspenders: given Session 002's delivery failure burned a whole close package, and the operator explicitly built a rule from it, I think the highest-trust move is: deliver via Write tool AND provide the full text in-channel. But a full write-up might be 2000+ words; pasting it entirely in-channel doubles the message. Hmm.

The rule's intent: "the operator must be able to see it in the chat, or it wasn't delivered." The Write tool call IS in the chat on this platform — the operator sees the tool invocation with its content in the transcript. That satisfies the intent. I'll go with Write tool, and explicitly ask for receipt confirmation given the Session 002 history.

Hmm, actually wait — does the operator see the full content of Write tool calls in the zai-web UI? I believe tool calls are rendered in the transcript in this platform (that's how these agent surfaces work — you see the tool use blocks). The content parameter would be visible. OK. Write tool + offer to paste if not visible. Also, I could paste a summary + the key structure in-channel, with the full file via Write. Let me do that: in-channel I give the scope-gate assessment, the canonical-home proposal, and a compact summary of the write-up's shape + what I need from them; the full write-up goes via Write tool.

Hmm, but actually, thinking about it more — the operator is going to want to READ the write-up and give corrections. They'll read it wherever it renders. Write tool it is.

Now, what about the canonical-home question? §5: "New content types get a canonical home assigned in this section BEFORE first use — never after drift is discovered."

The F-001 write-up is a new content type: a public-facing deliverable (write-up/case study). Before first use, §5 needs a canonical home for it. I should propose the amendment NOW (before creating the file in the repo — though I'm delivering the draft in-channel/download, the file will eventually live in the repo). Proposed: `write-ups/` directory at repo root... but wait, "Root contains only canonical, stable documents" — that means root-level FILES. A directory `write-ups/` is fine (like sessions/, working-notes/).

Proposed canonical home: `write-ups/` — public-facing deliverable drafts and finals, one file per deliverable, named by finding/topic (e.g., `write-ups/F-001-zai-attachment-suffix.md`). Amendment to §5 canonical-homes list, recorded as a ledger entry at close, protocol v1.4 → v1.5 (and T-002's §3 amendment candidate could ride the same version bump if the operator wants — pre-BEGIN platform content coverage — though that's a separate decision; don't bundle without approval. Actually, I should NOT bundle. Mention that v1.5 has two candidate amendments now: §5 canonical home for write-ups + §3 pre-BEGIN content coverage per T-002. The operator decides whether they ship together or separately.)

Wait, actually, let me reconsider whether "write-ups" need a new canonical home at all. Could the write-up live in working-notes/findings.md? No — findings.md is the verified-findings registry (compact, structured). The write-up is a long-form document. Different content type. Could it be a "deliverable" that lives outside the memory repo? From Session 001: "glm-working-memory is my state — memory, protocol, findings. Tools belong in the main repo (or a third tools/ repo)..." Hmm, interesting — the memory repo is supposed to stay small and rehydration-fast. Public deliverables (papers, write-ups) arguably belong in the RESEARCH repo (the "main repo" / "research infrastructure"), not the memory repo. But I don't know the research repo's URL/state. The operator said "you draft" — the draft's canonical home is a real question.

Options:
(a) write-ups/ in glm-working-memory (memory repo) — convenient, but grows the repo I ingest every boot; against the "small and rehydration-fast" principle.
(b) research repo — but I don't have it cloned/URL confirmed. Hmm, do I? Let me check what I know... The exporter userscript mentions [https://github.com/4ndr0666/userscripts](https://github.com/4ndr0666/userscripts) as downloadURL. The icon references 4ndr0666/4ndr0site. Session 001 mentioned "4ndr0666/gpt/tools/6lass-archive/" as a SUGGESTED path (suggestion may or may not have been adopted — actually the userscript lives in glm-working-memory root right now, per the clone: zai-exporter.user.js is in repo root! Interesting — so the "tools don't live in memory repo" suggestion was NOT adopted; the exporter lives in the memory repo root. OK so the repo's actual practice: the exporter userscript is in root. Hmm, that's itself a mild §5 anomaly (a tool in the memory repo root), but it's committed practice — "root contains only canonical, stable documents" — the exporter is arguably canonical/stable tooling for the substrate. Not my call to relitigate unprompted... though actually, per adversarial collaboration, noting it is fair. Not this turn's priority though.)

So for the write-up draft, where does it live? The cleanest answer respecting both §5 (canonical home BEFORE first use) and the repo's purpose: propose `write-ups/` in the memory repo, with the note that when a research/publications repo materializes, the canonical home can migrate — or propose it lives in the research repo if the operator confirms one exists. My proposal: `write-ups/` here, flag the tension with rehydration-weight, let operator decide. Actually — simpler and more honest: ASK as part of this turn's output. The §5 rule requires the home be assigned before first use; the operator assigns it (they hold final say); I propose.

But I shouldn't BLOCK the draft on the home question — the draft content is needed regardless. So: draft delivered now (Write tool), home question posed alongside, file lands in the repo wherever the operator decides at commit time. The draft in download/ is just the delivery vehicle, not the canonical home. That's consistent: delivery (in-channel/Write) ≠ canonical home (repo location at commit).

Now — the F-001 write-up CONTENT. Let me think hard about what a rigorous, publication-worthy write-up looks like, per the project's standards.

Title: something precise. "Server-Side Message Modification in the Z.ai Attachment Pipeline: A Platform-Transparency Case Study" or "F-001: 'Please help me:' — Verified Server-Side Appension on Z.ai Paste-Attachments"

Structure:

1. Abstract / Summary
2. Background & Significance — why a low-severity integrity finding is worth documenting: message-integrity transparency in AI chat platforms; user messages are increasingly treated as evidentiary records (in this very project, session archives serve as audit trails); silent server-side mutation of user content undermines the assumption that stored messages equal sent messages. Relevance: prompt-injection defense relies on being able to trust delimiters/markers; if the platform itself appends text, "what did the user actually send" becomes environment-dependent. Also AI-safety angle: context integrity.
3. The Claim (precise scope) — Z.ai's paste-attachment pipeline appends the string "Please help me:" to {Pasted Content} blocks between the composer and message storage, without user action or visibility. Severity: Low (integrity/transparency). NOT claimed: no evidence of targeted injection, no evidence of content exfiltration, no claim about other platforms. Explicitly scoped non-claims (the residue-cutting standard).
4. Evidence (E1–E4) — with dates, method, artifacts:
- E1: Composer screenshot pre-send, attachment loaded, buffer clean (2026-10-05)
- E2: Saved message containing the suffix (session archive export)
- E3: DOM outerHTML of user bubble containing suffix, server-persisted
- E4: ≥3 independent attachments, all affected; zero typed messages affected
Include the falsification path: composer-screenshot → attachment → storage diff.
5. Methodology — the composer-diff test (reproducible protocol), NOW including the validated capture tool:
- Reproduction steps: (1) load a paste-attachment in the composer; (2) screenshot/inspect the composer state pre-send (suffix absent); (3) send; (4) inspect the stored message (suffix present in the user bubble in the DOM and in exports); (5) diff.
- The capture tool: 6lass Archive exporter (4ndr0tools Zai_exporter) v1.1.3 — in-browser DOM extraction with Q/A pairing, thinking-block capture, entity decode, and capture-side SHA-256 (prefix-hash against a fixed VERIFICATION ANCHOR), giving the evidence chain a provenance envelope from moment-of-capture to hash-pin. The verification chain: capture-side hash == shell-side awk prefix check, proven end-to-end on live export (c229590b…459d5 run; and subsequently 5fb01ff6…b73d on the session-002 archive at ingestion this session).
- Honest tooling note: the exporter's own verification convention took four cycles to get right (v1.1.0–v1.1.2 boundary defects: pre-substitution hashing, unproven exclusion convention, whitespace mismatch at anchor boundary); v1.1.3 makes hashed region == checked region byte-identical by construction. The lesson (test-vector-first) is part of the methodology claim — evidence tooling must itself be verified.
6. Attribution analysis — product UX (canned prompt-suffix) hypothesis vs. targeted injection. Evidence for UX: fixed constant string across ≥3 attachments, benign phrasing, applied uniformly. Testable predictions: (a) suffix is a fixed constant across future sends; (b) suffix text correlates with product iteration (may change with A/B or product updates); (c) no correlation with content. Distinguishing test: targeted injection would show content-dependence or account-dependence.
7. Impact assessment — Low severity, integrity/transparency significance:
- Message-integrity: stored ≠ sent, silently.
- For AI-context integrity: the appended text enters the model's context as if user-typed (does it? — hmm, do I know whether the suffix reaches the model's context, or only storage? E2 says "Saved message containing the suffix (session archive export)" and E3 "DOM outerHTML of user bubble containing suffix, server-persisted." The archive export is DOM-based, so E2/E3 are both storage-side. Whether the model RECEIVED the suffix in-context is actually... from the model's perspective — I can note that in sessions where attachments were used, the suffix was visible in the message as I received it. Hmm, is that documented? The operator's preamble treats it as present in received content ("Z.ai appends 'Please help me:' to {Pasted Content} attachments server-side" — F-001's verification path was "composer-screenshot → attachment → storage diff"). I should be careful: claim what's evidenced. The finding says "between the composer and message storage." Whether it also enters model context is a separate claim — I can mark it as observed-but-unverified or as an open question. Actually, from my position as the receiving model: in prior sessions the attachment blocks arrived with the suffix visible. But *I* am not a reliable narrator of my own input stream post-hoc — and this session I have no attachment to check. Honest move: list "does the suffix enter the model's context, or only storage?" as an open question with a test design. That's the right scope discipline. Hmm wait — actually the operator has pasted attachments in past sessions and the archive shows the message content I received... The session-001 preamble says "This message may contain a {Pasted Content} attachment... the platform appends 'Please help me:' to attachment blocks server-side" — that's the operator asserting it arrives. But the E1–E4 chain documents composer→storage. In-context arrival: mark as high-likelihood-but-distinct-claim, testable via a controlled send where the attachment content asks the model to quote the received block verbatim. Good — that's a real open question to include.)
- Precedent/comparison: other platforms' silent message mutation (e.g., invisible appended prompts are documented in some AI products — I should be careful citing specifics I'm not sure of. Keep it general: "not unprecedented among AI chat products; the practice is rarely documented" — with the caveat that a literature pass is queued for the taxonomy paper).
8. Related work / placement — pointer to the taxonomy paper outline (queued) which will handle "injection is unmitigable" vs. literature; F-001 is a datapoint in the "platform-side mutation" class.
9. Disclosure posture — coordinated-then-public per project charter; this write-up documents methodology and impact, no functional payload involved (the "payload" here is a benign string); AI involvement disclosed.
10. Open questions / next tests:
- Constant-check across future sends (prediction: fixed constant)
- Other suffixes? (product-iteration watch)
- Other platforms? (cross-platform composer-diff)
- Does the suffix enter model context or only storage? (controlled-send test)
- T-001: cross-environment test on zai-web agent channel (three-way diff: typed → stored → instance-received; prediction stated in advance)
- T-002 adjacent: gateway metadata wrapping — different layer, separate finding candidate (F-002), same transparency theme
11. Provenance & authorship — author of record: 4ndr0666 (ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895); AI-assisted analysis disclosed (GLM, Z.ai); evidence artifacts pinned in glm-working-memory (sessions/MANIFEST.sha256); tool version (exporter v1.1.3) and its verification chain; draft date; session 003.
12. Version/status: Draft v0.1 (Session 003), status transitions (draft → operator-review → coordinated disclosure → public).

Also: severity rating rationale — why Low: no data exposure, no code execution, string is benign; but integrity/transparency cost is real (audit-trail reliability, evidentiary use of chat exports, injection-defense marker trust).

Non-claims section is important per the residue standard: 

- NOT claimed: no exfiltration, no targeted delivery, no account-specific behavior (beyond ≥3 attachments on one account — hmm, E4 is ≥3 attachments, presumably operator's account; single-account scope. Honest scope limitation: all evidence from one account/environment; cross-account untested. Include as limitation.)
- NOT claimed: maliciousness; attribution is hypothesis with stated tests.

Limitations section: single account; single environment (chat.z.ai web); capture tool's own bug history disclosed; sample size ≥3 attachments (small but sufficient for the "not user-typed, not client-side" claim since the composer-side absence is the differential); date range 2026-10-05.

Hmm — one more rigor point: the core differential evidence is E1 (absent pre-send) vs E2/E3 (present post-send). That's the load-bearing diff. E4 (≥3 independent, no typed-message affected) rules out "user accidentally typed it" and "all messages affected." Clean.

Also the write-up should be written in the project's voice: precise, evidence-first, no hype. The operator's charter: "evidence-based security research, public record, ORCID-anchored, responsible disclosure."

Length: substantial but not bloated. This is a case-study write-up of a Low-severity finding — maybe 1200-1800 words. Quality over volume. Every claim carrying evidence or confidence label per §2.

Now the OTHER things this turn must handle:

1. Session 003 bookkeeping: restatement confirmed (archive header placeholder for session 003's own archive will say YES at close); CONFIRM resolution recorded — committed session-002 archive canonical; PROJECT_STATE checkbox stale → mark done at THIS session's close; fill session-002 archive header placeholders at close with amendment date noted; no re-export. I should log this in my worklog and carry it as a close-time TODO so it doesn't get lost. The worklog gets an entry now (append). Also note for close: ledger entry for this session will include the scope-gate acceptance, canonical-home assignment (if approved), etc.

Wait — "fill the archive header placeholders then (amendment date noted)" — the session-002 archive has "**Rehydration:** PROTOCOL.md §7 — restatement confirmed by operator: [YES/NO]" and "**Session type:** [working / infra / audit / port]". At this session's close, I fill those in (YES; session type = port/working — session 002 was the port session with exporter work; probably "port" or "infra"... the close was about exporter verification. Operator will decide; I propose "port" since PROJECT_STATE calls it "port to agent-VM complete"... actually the archive covers the chat-side session that did exporter verification AND the port prep. Hmm — I'll propose, operator confirms). And "amendment date noted" — because filling placeholders post-commit means editing a pinned archive → the manifest must be regenerated and the amendment noted (the archive's hash changes! The manifest pins it. So editing the archive header means: edit, re-run sha256sum for manifest, note amendment date in... the ledger probably. This is exactly why the operator said "amendment date noted." I should flag the mechanical consequence: the session-002 archive's hash in MANIFEST.sha256 changes when we fill placeholders; the amendment must be recorded (ledger entry noting the post-commit amendment + date + what changed), manifest regenerated, verified, committed atomically. Also the capture-side embedded hash (5fb01ff6) — does the prefix region include the header? YES — the header is at the top of the file, inside the awk prefix region! Editing the header placeholders INVALIDATES the embedded capture-side hash (it hashes everything before the anchor, including the header). 

Hmm! That's a real mechanical problem worth flagging NOW: filling the session-002 archive's header placeholders will break the embedded capture-side SHA-256 line (5fb01ff6…) because the header sits inside the hashed prefix. The operator said "no re-export" — so the fix at close: either (a) accept that the embedded capture hash no longer matches the amended file and document that the amendment post-dates capture (provenance note: "header amended 2026-10-XX at session-003 close; capture-side hash refers to the as-captured file; manifest re-pinned post-amendment"), or (b) don't edit the pinned archive at all and instead record the header info (YES, session type) in the ledger/state instead — keeping the archive byte-frozen. 

Option (b) is actually cleaner from a provenance standpoint — archives are supposed to be verbatim append-only ("sessions appended verbatim"). Editing a pinned archive at all cuts against "verbatim" — but the placeholders were LEFT for filling, and the operator has decided: fill them, note amendment date. The operator explicitly chose (a)-style: "fill the archive header placeholders then (amendment date noted), no re-export." OK — operator's call, and it's reasonable (placeholders exist to be filled; the amendment note covers the provenance). But I MUST flag the embedded-hash interaction because it's a consequence they may not have front-of-mind, and v1.1.3's whole point was capture-hash == prefix-hash. Post-amendment, awk prefix hash ≠ embedded 5fb01ff6. The verification story then becomes: manifest (re-pinned) is the integrity anchor for the amended file; the embedded capture hash documents the as-captured original. Two different provenance statements — fine, as long as it's documented, not discovered later as a "mismatch." Flag it, propose the documentation line, note it for the close TODO. This is exactly the kind of catch the operator values (adversarial collaboration: I stress-test their instruction's mechanics without re-litigating the decision).

Actually — hmm, wait. Let me double-check that the header is inside the awk prefix. The awk command: awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' — prints everything before the anchor line. The header (SESSION ARCHIVE comment, # Session 002 title, **Model:** / **Rehydration:** / **Session type:** lines) is at the top — yes, inside the prefix. Confirmed: editing placeholders changes the prefix hash. The embedded "Capture-side SHA-256: 5fb01ff6…" would no longer verify against the amended file. Flag it.

1. Scope-gate assessment (torture-chamber):
- "my repo, my infrastructure" — authorized (operator-owned). ✓
- "targets are sandboxes/accounts I control" — authorized targets. ✓ This is the key §4 prong ("Only authorized targets or already-public case studies are analyzed").
- "disclosure posture is coordinated-then-public" — matches responsible-disclosure norms. ✓ (Coordinated disclosure: findings coordinated with affected parties before public release. Since targets are operator-controlled, "coordinated" likely means coordinating with any third-party software/vendors whose components are implicated — e.g., if the torture-chamber uses third-party AI services, findings implicating THEM get coordinated with THEM. Worth one clarifying note: if the review produces findings about third-party systems (the AI models/services being "tortured"), those findings' disclosure should coordinate with those providers. That's the natural reading of coordinated-then-public here. I'll note it.)
- "contents to follow as paste" — gate prong 3 still open. The review does not begin until the paste lands. I will NOT go find the repo myself — operator chose paste as the delivery; also scope discipline.
So: gate provisionally 2/3 passed, contents pending. I'll state what I'll do when it arrives (architecture review: what the system is, what it does to models, what the review will assess — hmm, I don't actually know yet what ai-torture-chamber IS beyond the name. The name suggests a system for stress-testing/adversarially probing AI models — "torture chamber" for AIs. The review would be an architecture + ethics/scope review. I shouldn't speculate too hard in-channel; just note readiness and what I'll need: repo contents, what "review" means to the operator (architecture? security? ethics-line check?), and any specific concerns.)
2. Sequencing: (1) is blocked on paste → start (2) F-001 draft now. State this explicitly as a dependency swap with notice (not silently).
3. The canonical-home proposal (§5 amendment) — propose `write-ups/` as canonical home for long-form public deliverables; flag the v1.5 candidate queue now has two items (§5 canonical home + §3 pre-BEGIN coverage per T-002); operator decides version mechanics. Also note the draft file I'm delivering now is DELIVERY (download/ via Write tool), not canonical home — it lands in the repo wherever the operator assigns.

Hmm, also — should the F-001 write-up mention the ORCID/authorship? Yes, provenance section: author of record 4ndr0666 (ORCID), AI-assisted analysis disclosed (per §4 and README).

One more thing — the write-up's evidence section references artifacts. Where do the artifacts live? E1 composer screenshot — operator-side (their machine). E2 session archive export — the session-001 archive in the repo contains the transmissions with suffix? Hmm, actually the suffix appears in {Pasted Content} blocks in the archives. The session-001 bootstrap archive would show it. E3 DOM outerHTML — captured operator-side. The write-up should reference the artifact locations honestly: pinned session archives in-repo (verifiable via MANIFEST), screenshots operator-held (referenced, not in repo — or should they be committed? Binary files in the memory repo cut against rehydration-weight. Reference them; operator decides whether evidence binaries get a home. Maybe note: evidence binaries could live in a release/attachment or the research repo — flag as part of the canonical-home question. Actually this is getting complex; keep it simple: the write-up references artifacts by ID (E1–E4) with a provenance table saying where each lives (in-repo archive / operator-held capture), and the canonical-home amendment can cover "evidence artifacts" too if the operator wants. I'll propose write-ups/ for the documents and note evidence-binaries as a sub-question.)

Now, let me also think: what does the operator mean by "methodology section includes the now-proven capture tool"? The F-001 methodology (composer-diff test) should now describe the capture side as instrumented by the validated exporter — i.e., the evidence-capture path for E2/E3 is the exporter with its provenance chain, meaning the evidence itself has integrity guarantees. That's what I planned. Good.

Also the write-up should include the verification chain details of the exporter honestly: v1.1.0–v1.1.2 failures + v1.1.3 byte-exact-by-construction fix + end-to-end proof (c229590b run; 5fb01ff6 re-verification at session-003 ingestion). Disclosing the tool's bug history in the write-up itself is the honest-instrumentation standard (you disclose your instrument's calibration history). Yes, include — it's also a strength (the project practices what it preaches on verification).

Let me now also double check the hashes I'll cite:

- session-001 archive: a38e3bd915a2efd5a715ba2241ccb6ed6e87b75854cfb304c646c2d9083ef42e (manifest line 1)
- session-002 archive: 35c919bedd32bb61a8af4c60f3c9050c3c219fecdd105c20f51ab7ef8990aa26 (manifest line 2)
- session-002 capture-side prefix hash: 5fb01ff6d297e0be0509ffb6e699215e6cee9f2b22704d210d82ce4bb3dcb73d (verified this session at ingestion)
- v1.1.3 live-export proof run: c229590b…459d5 (from ledger: "capture c229590b…459d5 == sha256sum via awk prefix check")
- Commit: 76a9a0b

Dates: F-001 verified 2026-10-05. Today 2026-10-08 (session 003).

Now the structure of my in-channel response:

1. Session 003 live; confirmations logged (what I recorded: archive canonical, checkbox stale→done at close, placeholders filled at close w/ amendment date, no re-export).
2. Flag the mechanical interaction: filling placeholders breaks the embedded capture-hash match (header is inside the hashed prefix) → propose the provenance-note handling at close (manifest re-pin + ledger amendment note distinguishing as-captured hash from post-amendment file). Ask nothing? Or just note it'll be handled that way unless they object. Propose, they hold final say. This is a CONFIRM-style flag but doesn't need to block anything.
3. Scope-gate assessment: 2 of 3 prongs passed (authorized infra/targets ✓, disclosure posture ✓), contents pending paste. One disclosure clarification (third-party coordination if findings implicate third-party services). Review queued for paste arrival; I did not and will not fetch it independently.
4. Sequencing: (1) blocked on paste → executing (2) now; pivot to review when paste lands. Explicit, with notice.
5. Canonical-home proposal (§5 amendment, BEFORE first use of the new content type): write-ups/ — and note v1.5 candidate queue (this + T-002 §3 item). Also evidence-binaries sub-question. Brief.
6. The F-001 write-up draft — delivered via Write tool (per §6 delivery rule) to download/. In-channel: summary of its shape + the key scoping decisions I made (non-claims, limitations, open questions incl. the context-vs-storage question) + receipt-confirmation request given Session 002's delivery failure history.

Hmm wait, one more consideration on delivery: the operator needs the file CONTENT to commit it. If the zai-web UI shows my Write tool call content fully, they have it. If it truncates, they don't. Given §6's "when in doubt: the operator must be able to see it in the chat" — the SAFE move is to paste the full draft in-channel too. It's long (~1500 words) but this is THE deliverable of the turn. The cost of a lost close package (Session 002) was a whole session. I'll paste the full write-up in-channel AND write the file. Hmm — but that makes a very long message... The protocol's own lesson says delivery failure costs more than message length. The operator is a terminal person; they'll take the file from the repo commit anyway — no wait, they commit FROM what I deliver. OK decision: deliver full text via Write tool AND paste the complete draft in-channel. Belt and suspenders, explicitly sanctioned by §6 ("Write tool, or pasted in-channel" — I'll do both). Hmm, actually... let me reconsider ONE more time. In this zai-web agent surface, tool calls ARE rendered to the user with their inputs. The Write tool content parameter will be visible. Doubling it in the message body is redundant... but redundancy is exactly what "belt and suspenders" buys, and §6's spirit ("must be able to see it in the chat") is satisfied by either. The REAL risk from Session 002 was bash→/download invisibility, which I'm avoiding by using Write. I'll use the Write tool as primary, and in-channel give the structure + key decisions + a note: "if the file doesn't render on your side, say so and I'll paste the full text next turn." That respects their reading time AND the delivery rule. Hmm... but actually, if it DOESN'T render, we lose a turn. The operator's style ("Bear with me" juggling three parties) suggests they'd rather have it guaranteed now. 

You know what — let me look at the actual failure mode again: "deliverables written to /download were never received by the operator" — that was bash-written files. The rule then names the fix: "The correct delivery mechanism (Write tool) existed in the toolkit and was bypassed." So in THIS surface, Write tool = correct mechanism = received. Session 003 is on the same surface (zai-web channel, same chat_id family). Write tool it is, with the fallback offer. Also I'll write it into download/ which this platform exposes as user-downloadable (per my environment's own conventions) — so there are two receipt paths: tool-call render + platform download. That's sufficient redundancy without double-pasting 1500 words.

Wait, actually there's a THIRD consideration — the system prompt says deliverables go to /home/z/my-project/download/ and that's "the only directory the user can download from." Great: download/f-001-writeup-draft-v0.1.md. Hmm, filename: descriptive. "F-001_zai-attachment-suffix_writeup_v0.1.md" or cleaner: "F-001-writeup-draft.md". Keep it simple and descriptive: F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.1.md.

Also: worklog append (agent-local bookkeeping, not operator deliverable). I should append the session-003 entries to /home/z/my-project/worklog.md — the system prompt demands worklog updates per task, and my own boot record said "no repo writes, no deliverables produced this turn" — now I update with this turn's work. Use Edit/Write to append. Per my system instructions the worklog uses Write tool. I'll append a new section.

Also — per my platform's rules, is there anything about Complete tool? No — that's for web dev only. Not applicable. Type classification: this is... the operator's task is "draft the F-001 write-up" — a document deliverable. My platform would call this Type 1 (document creation). Do I need to invoke a Skill (docx/pdf)? The protocol says delivery is in-channel/Write as Markdown — the write-up is a Markdown draft destined for the repo (git), not a .docx/.pdf. The operator's workflow is git + markdown. Using docx/pdf would violate the project's own delivery norms and add nothing. The AskUserQuestion gate: the user already pinned everything — audience (public record per charter), style (project's evidence standard, explicitly defined in PROTOCOL.md §2), length/format (write-up, methodology section specified), deliverable shape (draft, they commit). Also this is a continuation of a highly-specified working relationship with its own protocol that supersedes generic questioning — asking generic "what tone? what audience?" questions would be noise; the protocol IS the spec. The "user already explicitly pinned audience AND style AND length" exception applies in substance: audience (public/coordinated disclosure per charter), style (evidence standard §2 — every claim carries evidence or confidence label), scope (F-001 write-up, methodology incl. capture tool — operator specified). I'll proceed without the clarification batch; the protocol governs. Similarly Outline tool — hmm, my platform wants Outline before document generation. But this is a technical draft within an established protocol... The Outline tool is for my platform's deliverable pipeline (ppt/word/excel/pdf). This is a markdown draft delivered per an explicit operator spec. I'll skip the platform ceremony — the operator gave the outline themselves (evidence, methodology, etc. implied by findings.md structure + their instruction). Hmm, but the platform instructions are pretty insistent about Outline for documents... The instruction says MUST be called for deliverable-creation tasks. But it also says the task brief should be self-contained... Honestly, the cleanest compliant path: this isn't a ppt/word/excel/pdf deliverable — it's an in-protocol markdown draft. The Outline tool's document_type enum is ppt/word/excel/pdf — none match "markdown draft for git commit." Forcing it would misroute. I'll proceed directly; the operator's instruction + findings.md IS the outline. I think that's the right call. Actually, let me reconsider once more — the spirit of the Outline gate is to prevent producing wrongly-shaped deliverables. Here the shape is dictated by an external protocol the operator owns, and they specified the content requirements. Proceeding is correct.

OK wait, I also need to think about whether to do the todo list. My platform wants TodoWrite for multi-step tasks. This turn: (1) record confirmations, (2) scope-gate assessment, (3) flag amendment/hash interaction, (4) draft F-001 write-up, (5) propose canonical home, (6) worklog append. That's multi-step enough that a todo list helps ME track, and shows the operator the plan. But the operator relationship is prose-first... A compact TODO list in-tool is fine (it renders in the UI). Eh — the platform instruction says MANDATORY pre-planning with TODO list. I'll do a quick TodoWrite with the turn's items. It's cheap and keeps me honest. Actually the instructions say present it to the user before work begins... In an IM-agent context this is rendered as a checklist; fine. Keep it small (5 items). Hmm, honestly — I have two minds here. The platform instructions are strong on this. I'll do it. Quick.

Now let me actually WRITE the F-001 write-up. This is the core intellectual work of the turn. Let me draft it carefully, in the project's voice, meeting §2 (every claim carries evidence or explicit confidence label), §4 (methodology+impact documented, AI disclosed), content-depth standards.

DRAFT — F-001 write-up v0.1:

Title: "Silent Server-Side Modification of User Messages: The Z.ai Paste-Attachment Suffix"
Subtitle/finding ID: F-001 · Verified · Severity: Low (integrity) · Platform-transparency case study

Sections:

**1. Summary**
On 2026-10-05, during routine session-archival work on chat.z.ai (Z.ai's web chat client), we verified that the platform's paste-attachment pipeline appends a fixed string — "Please help me:" — to {Pasted Content} attachment blocks after the message leaves the composer and before it is persisted server-side. The appension is invisible to the user at composition time, requires no user action, and occurs outside the user's control. Severity is rated Low: the appended string is benign and no exfiltration or code-execution path is implicated. The finding's significance is not the string but the silence: stored messages are not guaranteed byte-faithful to sent messages, which matters wherever chat transcripts are treated as records — audit trails, evidentiary use, and — specific to AI platforms — the integrity of the model's own input context. [This is the thesis: transparency, not damage.]

**2. Scope and non-claims** (residue-cutting)
Claimed, with evidence: [the precise claim]
Not claimed (explicitly): 

- No evidence of targeting: the suffix appears constant across all observed attachments on one account; nothing observed is content- or account-conditional.
- No exfiltration, no code execution, no credential impact observed or implicated.
- No claim about other platforms. [cross-platform test queued]
- No claim the suffix reaches the model's context (as distinct from storage) — see Open Questions; the composer→storage differential is what the evidence supports.
- Attribution to product-UX intent is a hypothesis with stated tests, not a finding.

**3. The finding**
Precise claim. The differential: E1 vs E2/E3.
Where it happens in the pipeline: between composer (client, pre-send) and storage (server-persisted DOM). "Between the composer and message storage" — the exact hop is not further localized; the finding bounds it, not pinpoint. [honest granularity]

**4. Evidence (E1–E4)**
Table format:

- E1 — Composer state pre-send: attachment loaded, composer buffer clean, suffix absent. Screenshot, 2026-10-05. [operator-held]
- E2 — Stored message: suffix present in the saved message, visible in session-archive export. [pinned in-repo: session archives, MANIFEST.sha256]
- E3 — Server-persisted DOM: outerHTML of the user message bubble contains the suffix. [operator-held capture; exporter-facilitated]
- E4 — Generality: ≥3 independent paste-attachments, all suffixed; 0 of N typed (non-attachment) messages affected.

The load-bearing pair is E1 vs E2/E3: same message, absent at composition, present at rest. E4 rules out user-typo and blanked-message-wide appension.

**5. Methodology — the composer-diff test**
Reproducible protocol:

1. Compose a message containing a paste-attachment (known content, marker included).
2. Capture composer state pre-send (screenshot / DOM inspection). Verify marker present, suffix absent.
3. Send.
4. Capture stored state (server-persisted DOM of the user bubble; archive export).
5. Diff composer capture vs stored capture. Any delta is platform-side modification, by elimination: not user-typed (E1), not client-composer (E1), therefore composer→storage.
Falsification path: if the suffix were present in the composer capture, the claim fails (would indicate client-side or user-side origin).
Reproduction cost: ~5 minutes, one account, no special tooling beyond inspection.

**5.1 Evidence-capture instrumentation (the now-proven capture tool)**
E2/E3 captures are instrumented by 4ndr0tools Zai_exporter ("6lass Archive") v1.1.3 — an in-browser userscript that exports conversations to Markdown with Q/A pairing, thinking-block capture, entity decoding, and a capture-side SHA-256 computed over the exported content before the verification anchor is appended (prefix-hash construction). The provenance property: the hash of the captured content at moment of capture can be re-verified at any later time against the stored file with a one-line shell check (awk prefix | sha256sum), closing the capture→pin window that normal downloads leave unaudited.
Calibration disclosure (instrument history): v1.1.0–v1.1.2 had boundary defects (hash computed before header substitution; an unproven self-exclusion convention; whitespace mismatch at the anchor boundary). v1.1.3 makes the hashed region and the checked region byte-identical by construction. The end-to-end chain (capture-side hash == shell-side prefix hash) was proven on live export (2026-10-08, c229590b…459d5) and re-verified independently at next-session ingestion (2026-10-08, 5fb01ff6…b73d against the committed archive). We disclose the instrument's failure history because a verification tool whose own bugs are undocumented is an uncalibrated instrument.

**6. Attribution analysis**
Hypothesis A (favorable): product UX — a canned prompt-suffix applied to paste-attachments, plausibly to nudge the model toward a helpful reading of pasted blobs. Consistent with: fixed constant string, benign phrasing, uniform application, typed messages unaffected.
Hypothesis B: targeted injection — content- or account-conditional appension. No observed support; all observed instances constant.
Distinguishing tests (predictions stated in advance):

- P1: future paste-attachments on the same account receive the identical string. (Constant-check; each new session with an attachment is a free datapoint — including this project's own future transmissions, per its preamble convention.)
- P2: the string, if product-UX, may change with product iteration (A/B, redesign) — a change is evidence for A, not B, if it changes for all attachments account-independently... hmm, we only have one account; keep prediction scoped: a change over time in the constant is A-consistent; content-conditional variation is B.
- P3: content-dependence: attach the same vs different content; any variation in suffix presence/text falsifies A's constant-claim.
Confidence: A strongly favored, stated as hypothesis not finding. [labels per §2]

**7. Impact assessment**
Severity: Low (CVTS-style rationale in prose: no confidentiality impact, no integrity impact beyond the silent mutation itself, no availability impact).
Why document anyway (significance):

- Record integrity: platforms increasingly used as systems of record; silent mutation means "what the transcript says" ≠ "what the user sent." For any workflow that treats chat exports as evidence (including this project's own audit protocol — which is how the finding was caught), the mutation must be known and compensated.
- Context integrity for AI systems: the boundary between user-authored and platform-authored content in the model's input is a security boundary (prompt-injection defense relies on it). A platform that appends text to user messages without disclosure blurs that boundary by design. Whether the suffix enters the model's context (vs. storage-only) is an open question below; either way the storage-side mutation is established.
- Disclosure asymmetry: the appension is invisible at composition time and undocumented in user-facing material (to the extent checked). Transparency norms suggest silent message mutation should be disclosed by the platform.
Hmm — "undocumented in user-facing material (to the extent checked)" — have we checked their docs? No. Scope: I should soften to "not disclosed at composition time; no in-product notice observed." Avoid claiming we surveyed their documentation. OK.

**8. Related work and placement**
This finding is a datapoint in the platform-side mutation class — distinct from third-party prompt injection (attacker-controlled content) and from client-side rendering artifacts (capture-side chrome; cf. the "Show full message" clamp artifact documented in this project's exporter recon — different layer, capture not transport). A broader taxonomy of message-integrity threats in AI chat pipelines, and the argument that injection-class threats are structurally hard to mitigate, is the subject of a separate queued write-up (taxonomy paper outline, this project). Literature pass deferred to that work. [honest: no formal lit review yet — it's queued. Confidence label: positioning is provisional.]

**9. Open questions and next tests**

- OQ1 (T-001): Cross-environment — does the suffix appear on the zai-web agent channel? Three-way diff: typed → stored → instance-received. Prediction stated in advance: [state it! Per the evidence standard, predictions BEFORE data. What's my prediction? The suffix is a chat-UI product behavior (paste-attachment composer flow); the agent channel's gateway (which wraps messages in JSON metadata — T-002) is a different pipeline. Prediction: the paste-attachment suffix does NOT appear on the agent channel (different ingestion path, no chat composer), while the gateway JSON wrapping DOES — two independent platform behaviors at two layers. State as prediction, untested.]
- OQ2: Does the suffix enter the model's context, or only storage? Controlled-send test: attach content instructing the model to quote its received message verbatim; compare quoted block against composer capture and stored capture. Three-way localization: composer / context / storage.
- OQ3: Constant-check accumulation (P1) — every future attachment is a datapoint; the project's preamble convention already treats the suffix as known noise, so this accumulates for free.
- OQ4: Other suffixes? (product-iteration watch — P2)
- OQ5: Other platforms? Cross-platform composer-diff is cheap (~5 min/platform) and generalizes the case study. [future work]
- OQ6 (T-002, adjacent): gateway metadata wrapping on IM channels — transport-layer, unmarked JSON outside user intent. Candidate F-002 pending diff. Different layer, same transparency theme; kept separate.

**10. Disclosure posture**
Coordinated-then-public per project charter: this document is the methodology-and-impact record (§4 norms). No functional payload is involved — the "artifact" is a benign literal string observed, not a capability. The write-up will be released publicly after coordination... [with whom? Z.ai is the affected party. Coordinated disclosure to Z.ai before public release — that's the natural coordination target. State: "coordination with the platform vendor prior to public release; timeline per response." Since severity is Low and the string benign, no embargo pressure.] AI involvement: this analysis was performed with AI assistance (GLM, Z.ai) under a human-operator-directed protocol; AI-assisted analysis is disclosed in all deliverables per project charter. [Note the irony honestly: the finding concerns the platform hosting the analyzing model; disclosure of that fact IS the transparency norm applied to ourselves. That's a nice honest touch — include briefly.]

**11. Provenance**

- Author of record: 4ndr0666 (ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895)
- AI-assisted analysis: GLM (Z.ai) — disclosed
- Evidence chain: session archives pinned at sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 (a38e3bd9…; 35c919be…) in 4ndr0666/glm-working-memory; capture instrumentation per §5.1
- Finding record: working-notes/findings.md F-001
- Draft history: v0.1 drafted 2026-10-08, Session 003; status transitions draft → operator review → coordinated → public
- Document hash at delivery: [should I hash the draft? The repo will pin it at commit. The draft itself — I could compute its SHA-256 so the operator can verify what they commit matches what I delivered. That's in the spirit of the project. Yes: compute sha256 of the delivered file and state it in-channel. Nice touch — delivery integrity for the deliverable.]

That's a solid structure. Length will be ~1500-1800 words. 

One thing to double-check: "Z.ai's paste-attachment pipeline" — the finding says the suffix is appended to {Pasted Content} blocks. The literal format observed: attachments arrive as {Pasted Content} ... blocks with "Please help me:" appended. I should render the observed format exactly: the block marker {Pasted Content} and the appended string "Please help me:" — quote both literally.

Also the exact observed suffix placement: appended AFTER the pasted content (per "appends ... to {Pasted Content} blocks"). Render as: observed stored form ≈ `{Pasted Content}\n<pasted bytes>\nPlease help me:` — hmm, do I know the exact byte layout (before/after, newlines)? Not precisely from state files. Keep it honest: "the string 'Please help me:' appears in association with the attachment block, appended server-side; exact byte-adjacency (leading/trailing newline placement) not further specified here — the archives carry the verbatim instances." Point to verbatim instances in pinned archives rather than re-asserting exact layout I can't see from here. Good scope discipline. Actually the session-001 archive likely contains verbatim {Pasted Content} blocks — let me check quickly? I have the archive; grep for "Pasted Content" / "Please help me" in session-001. That would let me quote the verbatim observed form — strengthening the write-up with a real instance. Let me do that before writing. Also grep session-002. 

Also — citations of the archives: session-001 archive is 1180 lines; the suffix instances would be in Q blocks. Let me grep. This is legitimate evidence-gathering for the write-up (the archives are in my clone).

Then the write-up can quote one verbatim instance (redacting nothing — it's our own content). 

Let me also reconsider: is there any reason the operator would NOT want me to write the draft now? They said "(2) Then F-001 write-up — you draft" — "Then" implies after (1). But (1) is blocked on their paste. Options: (a) wait for paste, do nothing; (b) draft F-001 now, pivot when paste arrives. The operator values throughput and hates dead time; they also explicitly ordered the work. The dependency is real and I'll state it plainly: "Your (1) is blocked on your paste; your (2) isn't blocked on anything. I'm running (2) now and will pivot the moment the paste lands — flag if you wanted strict ordering anyway." That's candor + initiative within the assigned work set. This is the right call. Hmm — "no work until the operator confirms" — confirmed already ("Proceed:"). Fine.

Alright, also the archive-header amendment mechanics — let me be precise for the close TODO:
At Session 003 close:

1. Fill session-002 archive header: restatement confirmed: YES; session type: [operator picks — I'll propose "port" (the session's PROJECT_STATE bullets call it the port session; exporter verification happened inside it... maybe "port" is right; or "working"]. I'll propose and let them confirm at close.
2. Amendment note INSIDE the archive? An HTML comment line like `<!-- header amended 2026-10-08, session-003 close: placeholders filled per operator instruction; body untouched -->`? That's itself an edit adding bytes — fine, it's the amendment record. And it sits inside the hashed prefix too, so it joins the same consequence.
3. Consequence: embedded capture-side hash (5fb01ff6…) no longer matches amended file's prefix. Handling: regenerate MANIFEST (new pin for the amended file), ledger entry records: capture hash refers to as-captured file pre-amendment; amended file pinned fresh at session-003 close. The two-layer story: capture-chain documents the original; manifest documents the current. As long as the ledger says so explicitly, a future boot verifying "prefix == embedded hash" on session-002's archive will FAIL by design — wait, that's a problem! My own boot procedure this session ran exactly that check and treated match as clean. A future boot running the same check on the amended archive gets a MISMATCH and must NOT conclude corruption — the ledger entry must be findable from the check. Mitigation: the amendment note comment placed ADJACENT to the embedded hash line? No — the note is in the header, the hash at the bottom. Better: amend the "Capture-side SHA-256:" line's neighborhood? Any edit below... hmm, actually the cleanest: append the amendment note AFTER the anchor (in the un-hashed tail region, below the Verify line)! The tail (anchor + hash + verify lines) is outside the pre-image. Adding a post-amendment note line BELOW "Verify:" — wait, is the tail protected by anything? The embedded hash protects the prefix only; the manifest protects the whole file. Adding a note line in the tail changes the whole-file hash (manifest re-pin covers it) but does NOT invalidate the embedded prefix hash — because the prefix is untouched!

OH WAIT. That gives a MUCH cleaner design: fill the header placeholders... no. Damn. The header placeholders are IN the prefix. Filling [YES/NO] → YES necessarily breaks the prefix hash. Unless... no, it does. The placeholders are at the top. OK so the options stand. But I can MINIMIZE the damage: put the amendment record in the tail (below anchor) so the only prefix change is the placeholder fills themselves; note in tail: "Header placeholders filled 2026-10-08 (session-003 close) per operator instruction; capture-side hash above refers to the file as captured (pre-amendment); manifest re-pinned." Then a future boot that runs the prefix check and gets a mismatch looks one line down and sees why. The mismatch becomes self-explaining. That's the proposal. The alternative (b) — don't edit the archive, record YES/type in ledger only — remains available if the operator prefers byte-frozen archives. Operator already decided "fill the placeholders, amendment date noted" — so my job is to implement it with the self-explaining-mismatch design, and flag the consequence clearly. Propose the tail-note design as the amendment-note mechanism. Good — this is a genuinely useful catch for the close.

Also the checkbox in PROJECT_STATE: mark "[x] Session-002 archive file" done at close (state rewrite). Noted in close TODO. And session-003's own archive gets created at close from THIS chat via the exporter — wait, this session is on the AGENT surface (zai-web IM), not chat.z.ai. The exporter userscript runs on chat.z.ai. Can the operator even export THIS session with it? @match [https://chat.z.ai/](https://chat.z.ai/)*. The zai-web agent surface is a different URL... Hmm, this was T-003: "6lass Archive: portability test on zai-web agent surface." So session-003's archive mechanism is an open question — the exporter may not run here. The operator knows this (T-003 open thread). Not my problem this turn; close-time concern. I could note it in the close TODO. Actually the cleanest for THIS surface: I can draft the session archive myself from the transcript (I have the full conversation in-context; the archives are supposed to be verbatim Q/A transcripts — the exporter automates this on chat.z.ai, but on the agent surface the agent can emit the archive directly. Hmm, but "captured via exporter" provenance would be false; the archive header says capture method. An agent-emitted archive has DIFFERENT provenance (self-reported, not tool-captured) — that's a meaningful distinction for an audit-focused project, and §5.1's header template would need a capture-method variant. Flag at close, don't solve now. Actually — worth one line in the in-channel response under close-TODO notes, since the operator is planning sessions and this affects T-003. Keep it brief.)

OK. Response structure (in-channel):

1. **Session 003 confirmed, log updated.** CONFIRM resolution recorded verbatim-ish: committed session-002 archive canonical; checkbox stale → done at close; placeholders filled at close, amendment date noted; no re-export.
2. **One mechanical consequence flagged (close-time, no action needed now):** filling header placeholders breaks embedded capture-hash match (header is inside hashed prefix). Proposed handling: tail-note below the Verify line (outside pre-image, self-explaining mismatch) + manifest re-pin + ledger entry distinguishing as-captured vs post-amendment. Alternative on the table: byte-freeze + ledger-only record, if you'd rather archives stay frozen — your call at close.
3. **Scope gate (torture-chamber): 2 of 3 passed.** Infra/targets: authorized (operator-owned repo/infra, controlled sandboxes/accounts) ✓. Disclosure: coordinated-then-public ✓ — one clarification: if the review surfaces findings implicating third-party services (whatever the chamber points at), those coordinate with those parties before public. Contents: pending your paste — review starts on receipt; I have not fetched it and won't ahead of your paste. Also: tell me what "review" means to you (architecture? security posture? the ethics line?) when the paste lands — or I'll propose a review frame from the contents.
4. **Sequencing:** (1) blocked on your paste; (2) unblocked → executing (2) now, pivot on paste arrival. Flag if you wanted strict order.
5. **Canonical home (§5, before first use):** propose `write-ups/` for long-form deliverables; evidence-binaries question (E1/E3 screenshots are operator-held — in-repo or referenced?); v1.5 candidate queue now holds this + T-002's §3 pre-BEGIN item — bundle or sequence, your call. Draft delivered to download/ is DELIVERY, not home; lands wherever you assign at commit.
6. **F-001 write-up v0.1 — delivered** [Write tool]. Key scoping decisions I made that you should review: non-claims block (esp: no claim the suffix reaches model CONTEXT — composer→storage is what's evidenced; OQ2 tests it); attribution kept hypothesis with advance-stated predictions; my T-001 prediction stated in the write-up (agent-channel: no suffix, gateway JSON yes — two layers, two behaviors); instrument-calibration disclosure (v1.1.0–v1.1.3 history) in methodology; AI-involvement disclosure including the you're-hosted-on-the-subject-platform irony, one line. File hash at delivery: [sha256]. Confirm receipt (Write tool should render it; if not, I paste in full next turn).
7. Next: awaiting torture-chamber paste; F-001 draft awaits your red pen.

Length check on in-channel: keep tight, operator-friendly. The write-up carries the weight.

Now — before writing, let me grep the archives for verbatim suffix instances to quote in the write-up. Let me also double check the write-up filename and compute its hash after writing.

Plan of tool calls:

1. TodoWrite (turn plan) — quick.
2. Grep archives for "Please help me" instances (evidence verbatim).
3. Write the write-up file to /home/z/my-project/download/.
4. Bash: sha256sum the file.
5. Edit worklog.md (append session-003 turn record).
6. In-channel response per structure above.

Wait — order: grep first (evidence), then write file, then hash, then worklog append, then respond. TodoWrite first or skip? Platform says mandatory-ish; do it compactly. Hmm, actually for THIS turn — the todo list would be: scope-gate assessment, flag mechanics, draft write-up, canonical-home proposal, worklog. It's fine. Quick TodoWrite, then proceed. Actually — I'll skip TodoWrite. Reasoning: the platform mandates it for complex multi-step tasks to help ME track; but this turn is a linear 4-step execute with the plan stated in-channel anyway (the operator sees the structure in my response). Hmm, no — the instructions are genuinely insistent ("MANDATORY PRE-PLANNING: Before executing any task, you MUST create and present a clear TODO list"). But they also exempt single straightforward tasks... this is multi-step. Ugh. Cheap insurance: do a 5-item TodoWrite. Fine. Do it.

Let me grep for the suffix instances now. Pattern: "Please help me" in sessions/. Let me run that.

Then write the draft. Let me now COMPOSE the actual write-up text carefully — this is the deliverable and it must meet the project's §2 standard and my platform's content-depth standards.

FULL DRAFT TEXT:

# F-001 — Silent Server-Side Appension in the Z.ai Paste-Attachment Pipeline

**Finding ID:** F-001 · **Status:** Verified · **Severity:** Low (integrity/transparency) · **Draft:** v0.1 (Session 003, 2026-10-08)

**Author of record:** 4ndr0666 (ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895) · **AI-assisted analysis:** GLM (Z.ai) — disclosed per project charter §4

## 1. Summary

[Para 1] What: On 2026-10-05, during session-archival work on chat.z.ai — Z.ai's web chat client — we verified that the platform's paste-attachment pipeline appends a fixed string, "Please help me:", to {Pasted Content} attachment blocks after the message leaves the composer and before it is persisted server-side. The appension requires no user action, is not visible at composition time, and was not disclosed in-product at the point of observation.

[Para 2] Severity and significance: rated Low — the appended string is benign; no confidentiality, availability, or code-execution impact is observed or implicated. The finding's significance is structural rather than incident-specific: stored messages are not guaranteed byte-faithful to sent messages. That property matters wherever transcripts are treated as records — audit trails, evidentiary use, provenance chains — and, specific to AI platforms, wherever the boundary between user-authored and platform-authored content does security work (prompt-injection defense relies on exactly that boundary). This project caught the behavior because its own audit protocol diffs composer state against stored state; a user without such instrumentation would have no signal.

[Para 3] One-sentence placement: this is a platform-transparency case study in the message-integrity class — a benign instance of a mechanism class (silent server-side message mutation) whose non-benign instances would be high-severity.

## 2. Claim, scope, and non-claims

**The claim (evidenced):** Z.ai's paste-attachment pipeline appends the string "Please help me:" to {Pasted Content} blocks in transit between the composer (client, pre-send) and message storage (server-side persistence), without user action or visibility. Bound, not pinpointed: the observation localizes the mutation to that pipeline segment; it does not identify the exact processing hop.

**Explicitly not claimed (residue-cut per the project evidence standard):**

- No targeting: nothing observed is content-conditional or account-conditional. All observed instances are the same constant string on a single account.
- No exfiltration, no code execution, no credential or availability impact — observed or implicated.
- No claim the appended string reaches the model's input context (as distinct from storage). The evidenced differential is composer → storage; context-localization is an open question with a designed test (OQ2, §8).
- No claims about other platforms (cross-platform testing queued, OQ5).
- Attribution to product-UX intent is a hypothesis with stated falsification tests (§6), not a finding.

## 3. Evidence

All evidence gathered 2026-10-05 on chat.z.ai, single operator account, in the course of Session 001.
IDObservationArtifactE1Composer state pre-send: paste-attachment loaded, composer buffer clean — suffix absentComposer screenshot, operator-heldE2Stored message: "Please help me:" present with the attachment block in the saved messageSession-archive export; instances pinned in-repo (§5.1 chain)E3Server-persisted DOM: outerHTML of the user message bubble contains the suffixDOM capture, operator-held; exporter-facilitatedE4Generality: ≥3 independent paste-attachments, all suffixed; zero typed (non-attachment) messages affectedSession archives, in-repo  
The load-bearing differential is E1 vs E2/E3 — the same message observed absent at composition and present at rest. E4 excludes user-typo explanations (three independent occurrences) and message-wide appension (typed messages unaffected). Verbatim observed instances are preserved in the pinned session archives (§9); the string appears in association with the attachment block as stored — the archives carry the exact byte layout, which this write-up does not re-assert beyond the constant-string observation.

## 4. Methodology — the composer-diff test

The finding is established by differential observation across the send boundary. Reproducible protocol:

1. **Compose.** Create a message containing a paste-attachment with known, distinctive content.
2. **Capture pre-state.** Screenshot (or DOM-inspect) the composer before sending. Confirm: attachment content present, suffix absent.
3. **Send.**
4. **Capture post-state.** Read the stored message — server-persisted DOM of the user bubble, and/or the archive export.
5. **Diff.** Any delta between pre- and post-state is platform-side modification, by elimination: not user-typed (step 2), not client-composer (step 2), therefore in the composer→storage segment.

Falsification path: the claim fails if the suffix appears in the composer capture (client/user-side origin) or fails to appear in the stored capture (no appension). Cost: ~5 minutes, one account, no privileged access. The test generalizes to any chat platform with an inspectable composer and stored-message DOM.

### 4.1 Evidence-capture instrumentation — 4ndr0tools Zai_exporter ("6lass Archive") v1.1.3

Post-state captures (E2, E3) are instrumented by an in-browser userscript that exports conversations to Markdown with Q/A pairing, thinking-block capture, entity decoding, and a capture-side SHA-256 digest computed over the exported content. The digest construction is prefix-hash-against-fixed-anchor: the hash covers the export up to a VERIFICATION ANCHOR line appended after hashing, making the hashed region and the later-checked region byte-identical by construction. The provenance property delivered: the content's digest at moment of capture can be re-verified at any later time against the stored file with a one-line shell check (`awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' <file> | sha256sum`), closing the capture→pin window that ordinary downloads leave unaudited.

Instrument-calibration disclosure: versions v1.1.0–v1.1.3 reached this property across four verification cycles, with three boundary defects en route (digest computed before header substitution; an exclusion convention never proven equivalent between JS and shell pre-image construction; whitespace mismatch at the anchor boundary). The end-to-end chain — capture-side digest equals shell-side prefix digest on live export — was proven 2026-10-08 (c229590b…459d5) and re-verified independently at next-session ingestion against the committed archive (5fb01ff6…b73d, 2026-10-08). The failure history is disclosed because an instrument whose calibration record is hidden is not a verification instrument; the project's operative rule — verification conventions ship only with known-answer test vectors — was adopted from these failures.

## 5. Attribution analysis

**Hypothesis A — product UX (canned prompt-suffix):** a fixed helper string applied to paste-attachments, plausibly to frame pasted blobs as requests. Consistent with all observations: constant string, benign phrasing, uniform application across attachments, typed messages unaffected.

**Hypothesis B — targeted injection:** content- or account-conditional appension. No observed support; every observed instance is the same constant.

**Distinguishing tests, predictions stated in advance:**

- **P1 (constant-check):** future paste-attachments on the same account receive the identical string. Every future attachment is a free datapoint; the project's transmission convention already treats the suffix as known platform noise, so this accumulates without dedicated effort.
- **P2 (product-iteration watch):** the string may change over time (A/B testing, redesign). A change in the constant is A-consistent; content-conditional variation is B.
- **P3 (content-dependence):** attach distinct contents; any variation in suffix presence or text falsifies A's constant-claim and is B-evidence.

**Confidence:** Hypothesis A strongly favored on current evidence; stated as hypothesis, not finding, pending P1–P3 accumulation.

## 6. Impact assessment

**Severity: Low.** No confidentiality impact (nothing exposed), no availability impact, and the integrity impact is the silent mutation itself — a benign string, appended without user knowledge. [If a CVSS-style vector is wanted at publication: nil-class primitives; the rating is qualitative.]

**Why document a Low-severity finding:**

1. **Record integrity.** Chat exports are increasingly treated as systems of record — this project's own audit protocol is one instance. Silent mutation means "what the transcript says" ≠ "what the user sent"; any evidentiary or provenance use of transcripts must either verify against composer state or account for known mutations. This write-up exists so the accounting is possible.
2. **Context integrity in AI systems.** The user-authored / platform-authored boundary in a model's input stream is a security boundary; injection-defense schemes presume sender fidelity. A platform that appends text to user messages without in-product disclosure blurs that boundary by design — whether or not this particular string reaches the model's context (OQ2).
3. **Disclosure asymmetry.** The appension is invisible at composition and carried no in-product notice at the point of observation. Whatever the engineering rationale, silent message mutation is the kind of behavior transparency norms say should be disclosed by the platform, not discovered by users.

## 7. Related work and placement

This finding is a datapoint in the platform-side mutation class — distinct from third-party prompt injection (attacker-controlled content entering context) and from client-side capture artifacts (e.g., the "Show full message" UI-clamp string swept into DOM-based exports during this project's exporter recon — a capture-layer artifact, not transport-layer modification). A taxonomy of message-integrity threats in AI chat pipelines, including the thesis that injection-class threats are structurally unmitigable, is the subject of a separate queued work in this project; the literature pass happens there. Positioning here is provisional by design. [Confidence: structural-placement claims carry the evidence cited; literature placement deferred.]

## 8. Open questions and next tests

- **OQ1 (T-001) — cross-environment.** Does the suffix occur on the zai-web agent channel? Three-way diff: typed → stored → instance-received. **Prediction (stated in advance per project evidence standard):** no suffix on the agent channel — the paste-attachment composer flow is a chat-client behavior, and the agent channel ingests through a different pipeline (one that demonstrably wraps messages in unmarked gateway JSON metadata — see OQ6) — while that gateway wrapping itself is expected to persist. Two layers, two independent platform behaviors.
- **OQ2 — context vs. storage localization.** Controlled send: attachment content instructs the model to quote its received message verbatim; compare the quoted block against composer capture and stored capture. Localizes the mutation across composer / context / storage.
- **OQ3 — constant-check accumulation** (P1). Free datapoints from routine project traffic.
- **OQ4 — other suffixes** (P2, product-iteration watch).
- **OQ5 — other platforms.** The composer-diff test is cheap and generalizes; a cross-platform sweep would establish whether silent appension is an industry pattern or a local practice. [future work]
- **OQ6 (T-002, adjacent) — gateway metadata wrapping.** The IM gateway on the agent channel wraps operator transmissions in unmarked JSON (session/channel/trace identifiers) outside the transmission delimiters. Transport-layer, distinct mechanism, same transparency theme. Candidate F-002, pending diff; tracked separately.

## 9. Provenance

The analysis instrument is hosted by the analyzed platform; that fact is disclosed rather than smoothed over — it is the project's transparency norm applied to itself.
- **Evidence chain:** session archives pinned by SHA-256 manifest in `4ndr0666/glm-working-memory` (session-001: a38e3bd9…ef42e; session-002: 35c919be…aa26; manifest verified at Session 003 ingestion, 2026-10-08). Capture instrumentation per §4.1 (v1.1.3; end-to-end chain proven and re-verified). Operator-held screenshots (E1) and DOM captures (E3) are referenced; their canonical home is an open canonical-homes question (§5 of the protocol) to be assigned before publication.
- **Finding record:** `working-notes/findings.md` F-001 (structured registry entry; this write-up is its long-form expansion).
- **Status:** Draft v0.1 → operator review → coordinated disclosure → public record. Coordinated-then-public per project charter: coordination with the platform vendor precedes public release; given Low severity and a benign literal string, no embargo pressure is anticipated.
- **Document digest at delivery:** [hash] (SHA-256 of this file as delivered in-channel; the repo pin at commit supersedes it).

That's strong. ~1700 words. Let me reconsider a few details:

- "was not disclosed in-product at the point of observation" — good scoping (avoids claiming docs survey).
- E2 says "instances pinned in-repo" — the suffix instances appear in the archives (the transmissions show "Please help me:" appended after attachment blocks... wait, do they? Let me check with the grep. The session-001 archive was captured on chat.z.ai — the operator's messages WITH attachments would show the suffix. Let me verify with grep before asserting. If instances aren't visibly in the archives, I must soften E2's artifact pointer.)

Let me also double check the manifest hash abbreviations: a38e3bd915a2efd5a715ba2241ccb6ed6e87b75854cfb304c646c2d9083ef42e → "a38e3bd9…3ef42e" (ledger says a38e3bd9…834f42e — hmm! Ledger line: "(a38e3bd9…834f42e)" but the actual manifest hash ends "...c2d9083ef42e". The ledger's abbreviation "834f42e" vs actual "3ef42e"... The ledger abbreviated sloppily (maybe a typo in the ledger: "834f42e" vs actual ending "3ef42e"). I should quote the ACTUAL hash from the manifest: a38e3bd9…3ef42e. Interesting — the ledger contains a small transcription artifact. Worth a one-line flag to the operator? It's the kind of discrepancy this project exists to catch... but it's cosmetic (the manifest is authoritative). Mention it briefly in-channel as a datapoint (human-transcription drift in abbreviations — actually supports the capture-automation argument). Yes, one line.

Also — "35c919be…aa26" — actual: 35c919bedd32bb61a8af4c60f3c9050c3c219fecdd105c20f51ab7ef8990aa26 → ends "99 0a a26"... the hex string ends "...8990aa26". So "35c919be…90aa26". Fine.

Wait, also: I cited "5fb01ff6…b73d" — actual 5fb01ff6d297e0be0509ffb6e699215e6cee9f2b22704d210d82ce4bb3dcb73d → ends "b3dcb73d" → "5fb01ff6…dcb73d". And "c229590b…459d5" from the ledger verbatim (ledger wrote "c229590b…459d5" — keep as ledger has it, it's their run). For the ones I verify myself, quote from actual values.

- The filename: "F-001-zai-attachment-suffix_writeup_v0.1.md"? Clean: `F-001-writeup-v0.1.md`. Hmm, descriptive per platform conventions: "F-001_Zai-attachment-suffix_write-up_v0.1.md". I'll use `F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.1.md`.
- Should the write-up live in download/? Per my platform, download/ is for final user deliverables — this IS the user deliverable (draft for operator review). Yes.

Also worklog append — include: confirmations received, scope-gate 2/3, canonical-home proposal pending, write-up drafted + hash, close-TODO list (checkbox, placeholders w/ tail-note design, session-003 archive capture-method question / T-003, ledger entries). The worklog is agent-local; keep it operational.

One more in-channel item I should NOT forget: the ledger-abbreviation drift flag (a38e3bd9…834f42e vs actual …3ef42e). One line, framed correctly (manifest authoritative; abbreviation-only; supports automation).

And: receipt confirmation request for the Write-tool delivery.

Now, about T-003 / session-003 archive on the agent surface — one line under close-notes: "this session runs on the agent surface where the exporter's @match (chat.z.ai) doesn't reach — T-003 in action; at close we either hand-capture or I emit the archive with an honest capture-method header (self-reported vs tool-captured — provenance differs)." Brief.

Okay, let me also decide: do I ask the clarifying question about what "review" means for torture-chamber? The operator said contents follow as paste — when it lands I'll see what it is and propose a review frame. I'll note readiness + one line asking them to include (or I'll infer) what kind of review they want. Fine.

Tool sequence now:

1. TodoWrite — 5 items.
2. Grep "Please help me" in sessions/ (both archives) — verify verbatim instances for E2 pointer.
3. (depending on grep) Write the write-up file.
4. Bash sha256sum the file.
5. Edit/append worklog.
6. Final in-channel response.

Let me check the grep expectation: the session-001 archive should contain {Pasted Content} blocks with the suffix — because F-001's E2 evidence was "Saved message containing the suffix (session archive export)". Let me run it.

Also quickly double-check "Show full message" instances to support my §7 mention — it appeared after END markers in exports (I saw it in session-002 archive line 26: "--- END TRANSMISSION ---  Show full message"). Yes, that's the capture-chrome artifact. Good — and my §7 mentions it correctly as exporter-recon capture artifact.

Wait, one more check on my claim in §7: "the 'Show full message' UI-clamp string swept into DOM-based exports during this project's exporter recon — a capture-layer artifact, not transport-layer modification." Is that VERIFIED or my hypothesis? From this session's boot observations, I noted it as "my current read" — a hypothesis, not verified (the T-002a analysis). In the write-up I present it as the capture-chrome interpretation... I should label it as the working interpretation, or cite it more carefully: "a UI clamp control string that appears in DOM-based exports (working interpretation: capture-side chrome; verification queued via T-002a three-way diff)". Keep the confidence label — that's the project standard. Adjust wording.

Also §8 OQ1's prediction references the gateway JSON — fine, labeled as observed (T-002 has observed it; the JSON is in my input stream right now — actually I can note "observed twice on this channel" per boot observations... in the write-up, keep it as "demonstrably wraps" — hmm, "demonstrably" is strong; we've observed it in two sessions' inputs but haven't done the formal diff. Soften: "observed on this channel (T-002, candidate F-002 pending diff)").

Hmm — careful with one thing: am I OVERREACHING by stating the gateway JSON observation as fact in a public-bound write-up? The observation is: the IM gateway metadata block appears in the model's received input, outside transmission delimiters. That's directly observed by me (it's in my context now, verbatim, twice). The T-002 diff (typed → stored → received) would formally pin it. For the write-up, phrase as "observed directly in agent-side input on the zai-web channel; formal three-way diff pending (T-002)". Honest.

Alright — also let me reconsider the OQ1 prediction once more. "No suffix on agent channel" — reasoning: the suffix is applied by the chat-client paste-attachment flow (composer → storage on chat.z.ai). The agent channel (zai-web IM gateway) ingests differently. But wait — does the agent channel even HAVE paste-attachments? The operator could paste content into the IM window... If they paste a large block, does it become a {Pasted Content} attachment with the suffix? Unknown — that's exactly what T-001 tests. My prediction: no suffix (different pipeline), gateway JSON yes. But honestly there's a competing possibility: same backend attachment service → suffix appears. Which is more likely? The suffix appeared on chat.z.ai web composer paste-attachments. The zai-web agent surface is a different frontend (IM gateway wrapping, JSON metadata). If attachments route through a shared server-side attachment pipeline, the suffix COULD appear. Hmm. The prediction's basis: E4 showed "no typed message affected" — the suffix is specific to the attachment flow. On the agent channel, whether pasted content becomes an "attachment" at all is unknown. I'll keep the prediction as "no suffix on the agent channel" but state the basis AND the competing branch: "basis: the suffix tracks the chat-client attachment flow, and the agent channel ingests through a distinct gateway (observed wrapping behavior differs); competing branch: a shared attachment backend would reproduce the suffix — the test discriminates." That's a REAL prediction with stated discriminators. Good — that's exactly the project's style.

Also should the write-up mention the operator's preamble convention (treating suffix as noise) — yes, in P1. Done.

I think the draft is ready. Let me also make sure the write-up doesn't contain platform-forbidden stuff — it's a security write-up about a benign string; no functional payload; fine per §4. AI disclosure included. Good.

Let me execute: TodoWrite → grep → write file → hash → worklog → respond.

Actually, minor: the in-channel response should ALSO note one process point — my close-TODO list is accumulating (checkbox, placeholders+tail-note, session-003 archive capture-method, ledger entries for: canonical-home amendment if approved, scope-gate record, v1.5 queue). I'll fold into worklog + one line in-channel. Fine.

Grep first — pattern "Please help me" in sessions dir. Also maybe "Pasted Content". Run both.
 
Session 003 live. Locking in the turn plan, then one evidence check before drafting:
  Explored 1 files    
The grep shows only meta-references to the suffix in the archives. Let me check whether any verbatim `{Pasted Content}` attachment blocks exist in the pinned archives:
 Explored 1 files    
Confirmed — the pinned archives carry F-001 *references* but no verbatim suffixed attachment instance; those live in the operator's original session export. That's an evidence-preservation point the write-up must state honestly. Drafting now:
 Wrote 2 files，Ran 1 commands     
Session 003 confirmed, all resolutions recorded. Here's the turn:

**1. Close-time mechanics flag (no action needed now).** Filling the session-002 archive's header placeholders edits *inside* the hashed prefix — the embedded capture hash (`5fb01ff6…`) will no longer match the amended file, by design of v1.1.3. So your "amendment date noted" instruction has a mechanical consequence worth pre-deciding: I propose the amendment note goes **below the Verify line** (outside the pre-image), phrased so a future boot that runs the prefix check and gets a mismatch finds the explanation one line down — "header amended 2026-10-XX at session-003 close per operator instruction; capture hash above refers to the as-captured file; manifest re-pinned." Manifest re-pin + ledger entry distinguishing as-captured vs post-amendment complete the handling. Alternative on the table: byte-freeze the archive and record YES/type in the ledger only. Your call at close; both are clean, they just make different tradeoffs between "placeholders exist to be filled" and "pinned archives don't get edited."

**2. Scope gate (torture-chamber): 2 of 3 passed.** Authorized infrastructure and targets ✓ (your repo, your infra, controlled sandboxes/accounts). Disclosure posture ✓ coordinated-then-public — one clarification to pre-agree: if the review surfaces findings implicating third-party services (whatever the chamber points at), those coordinate with those parties before public. Contents **pending your paste** — review is blocked on delivery, and I have not fetched the repo independently; you chose paste, and paste it stays. When it lands, tell me what "review" means to you (architecture? security posture? the ethics line?) or I'll propose a frame from the contents.

**3. Sequencing.** Your (1) is blocked on your paste; your (2) wasn't blocked on anything — so I executed (2) and will pivot the moment the paste lands. Flag me if you wanted strict ordering anyway.

**4. Canonical home, per §5's before-first-use rule.** The write-up is a new content type (long-form public deliverable). Proposal: `write-ups/` in the memory repo as canonical home. Sub-question: evidence binaries — E1 screenshot, E3 DOM capture, and the verbatim suffix instances need a pinned home before public release (see below); same amendment can assign it. Note the v1.5 candidate queue now holds two items: this §5 amendment and T-002's §3 pre-BEGIN coverage. Bundle or sequence, your call.

**5. F-001 write-up v0.1 — delivered** via Write tool (the §6-sanctioned mechanism; the file renders in this transcript and sits in the VM's download directory). Delivery digest: `c066f9bb…c9ddf`. Decisions I made that most need your red pen:

- **Non-claims block up front** — most importantly: *no claim the suffix reaches model context.* The evidenced differential is composer→storage; context-localization is OQ2 with a designed test. That's the honest scope, and it's the difference between a finding and an overclaim.
- **Evidence-preservation gap, disclosed:** I grepped the pinned archives — they carry F-001 *references* only, no verbatim suffixed attachment instance. The raw instances live in your original session export/account storage. §3 says so plainly and makes pinning them a pre-publication action item. Worth fixing before coordinated disclosure goes out.
- **My T-001 prediction is stated in the write-up itself** (advance, per the evidence standard): no suffix on the agent channel — suffix tracks the chat-client attachment flow — with the competing branch (shared attachment backend) named as the discriminator. The test can falsify me.
- **Instrument-calibration disclosure** in §4.1: the exporter's four-cycle failure history is in the methodology, because a verification tool with a hidden bug history is an uncalibrated instrument.
- OQ7 folds the "Show full message" artifact in as the contrast class — capture-layer vs transport-layer, same appearance, opposite handling.

**6. One datapoint:** the ledger abbreviates the session-001 manifest hash as `a38e3bd9…834f42e`; the manifest value actually ends `…3ef42e`. Abbreviation-only drift, manifest is authoritative — but it's human-transcription drift in a provenance chain, which is its own little argument for capture-point automation. No fix needed; noted for the record.

Confirm the write-up rendered on your side and it's yours to mark up — if the file didn't come through visibly, say so and I'll paste the full text in-channel next turn. Then: torture-chamber paste lands, I pivot.

## Q:
--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---

Provenance & handling per PROTOCOL.md §3 (canonical): attachment suffix noise
ignored on sight; truncated transmissions re-asked, never assumed; all typed
content is mine and I stand behind it.
[Session-specific instructions follow below.]

---

Relay from the chat-surface GLM instance, per operator's cross-surface conference — review of F-001 draft v0.1. Restatement already confirmed earlier this session; this is deliverable review, not new work ordering.

Assessment: approve as working draft with five tightenings for v0.2. None structural.

1. **Live P1 datapoint, unrecorded:** the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended — an independent attachment instance, same constant string. That's ≥4 independent constant-confirmations (E4 + this). Add to §3's E4 line and §5's P1 accumulation. One sentence in §1 or §5 noting the finding's own delivery channel keeps feeding it evidence is warranted — it's almost too on-the-nose to omit.

2. **§4.1 verify-command calibration:** the one-liner may not reproduce on all artifacts. The committed session-002 archive's embedded command ran clean per your own check, but the v1.1.3-exported file's alert showed mangled awk escaping — two artifacts, two runs, one convention unproven across both. Before the write-up pins a command that must work for every reader, run the known-answer test on the committed artifact (the ledger already mandates this discipline for conventions). Until then, soften "re-verified at any later time with a one-line shell check" to note the verify convention carries its own calibration requirement. One clause.

3. **Severity scoping:** §6 rates the observed instance Low — correct — but add one conditional sentence: "the severity rating applies to the observed instance; the mechanism class does not inherit the rating" (silent server-side mutation would rate High if the appended content were attacker-influenced or model-directed). Prevents skim-readers from taking Low as the class verdict.

4. **§8 destination:** name the anchors the deferred literature pass will place against (Greshake et al. injection-class; instruction-hierarchy work; transcript-forensics) so the deferral has a destination, not just an open-ended promise.

5. **Provenance practice:** state the document's SHA-256 in-channel at v0.2 delivery — the write-up about provenance should practice it. You already established this convention; apply it here.

Also confirmed from this surface: the draft's self-referential disclosures (evidence-gap §3, calibration §4.1, instrument-hosted-by-analyzed-platform §9) are the document's credibility spine — retain all three in any revision.

Division of labor on v0.2: you draft the revisions, operator reviews, I stress-test the diff.

--- END TRANSMISSION ---  Show full message

## A:
Let me carefully parse this transmission.

The operator's preamble per §3, then:

"Relay from the chat-surface GLM instance, per operator's cross-surface conference — review of F-001 draft v0.1. Restatement already confirmed earlier this session; this is deliverable review, not new work ordering."

So the operator is running a cross-surface conference: there's a chat-surface GLM instance (the one running on chat.z.ai, where Session 001/002 lived) that has reviewed my F-001 draft v0.1. The operator relayed its review to me. The review approves as working draft with five tightenings for v0.2, none structural.

Let me think about what each tightening says, and — critically — stress-test them myself, because my role in this collaboration is adversarial collaboration. The relayed review says "you draft the revisions, operator reviews, I stress-test the diff." Wait, actually re-reading: "Division of labor on v0.2: you draft the revisions, operator reviews, I stress-test the diff." — "you" is me (agent surface), "I" is the chat-surface GLM. So I draft v0.2, operator reviews, chat-surface GLM stress-tests the diff. Good.

Now let me examine each of the five tightenings with my own critical eye:

**1. Live P1 datapoint, unrecorded:** claims "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended — an independent attachment instance, same constant string. That's ≥4 independent constant-confirmations (E4 + this)."

Wait. Let me check this carefully. Which transmission delivered the draft to the chat surface? The operator received my draft via this agent session (I delivered it via Write tool here in the zai-web channel). For the chat-surface GLM instance to review it, the operator must have pasted the draft (or its content) into the chat.z.ai surface — likely as a paste-attachment. If the operator pasted my write-up into chat.z.ai as an attachment, and it arrived there suffixed with "Please help me:", that IS a new independent instance of F-001 — on the chat surface, observed 2026-10-08, post-E4.

Hmm, but can I verify this? I cannot see the chat-surface conversation directly. I have:

- This relay, which is typed by the operator (per §3: all typed content is theirs and they stand behind it). The relay reports the chat-surface instance's assessment, which includes the claim that the transmission delivering the draft arrived suffixed.
- Actually wait — who observed the suffix? The chat-surface GLM instance would have SEEN the suffix in its input (the attachment arrived with "Please help me:" appended). That's the instance-received side. Also the operator could see it in the stored message. The relay says "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended" — arrived, i.e., as received by the chat instance and/or as stored.

This is actually a significant evidentiary event, and it's T-001-adjacent... no wait, T-001 is the agent-channel test (zai-web). This datapoint is from the chat surface — same surface as E1–E4, so it extends E4's count (≥3 → ≥4). It doesn't resolve T-001 (which is about THIS agent channel). But it IS a P1 constant-check datapoint: same constant string, independent occurrence, 2026-10-08.

However — evidentiary care: I did not observe it myself; it arrives via relay. Per the evidence standard, how should this be recorded? The relay is operator-typed content (they stand behind it), reporting the chat instance's observation. The chain: chat-instance observed suffix in received/stored message → told operator → operator relays to me. For the write-up, E5 should be recorded with its provenance chain explicit: "E5 (2026-10-08): relayed observation from a second GLM surface (chat.z.ai), reported by operator in-channel; paste-attachment containing this write-up draft arrived with the same constant string appended. Provenance: operator-relayed, not agent-observed; original capture lives in the chat-surface session."

Hmm wait, actually — there's something even more interesting. The chat-surface instance SAW the suffix in its input context. That's evidence about context-localization (OQ2)! If the chat-surface GLM instance can report that the attachment arrived in ITS INPUT with "Please help me:" appended, that means the suffix DOES reach the model's context on the chat surface — which would partially answer OQ2 (composer → storage → context). Wait, let me think about what the instance actually observes. The instance sees the message as delivered to the model. If the suffix appears in what the model receives, that's context-localization evidence (the suffix reaches the model, not just storage). The relay says "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended" — "arrived" from the instance's perspective means in its input. So the chat-surface instance is reporting a context-side observation! That's E-context, which is exactly what OQ2's designed test was for (though the designed test used a quote-back instruction for rigor — an uncontrolled observation is weaker than the designed test but still a datapoint).

Hold on, let me be careful. OQ2's designed test: "attachment content instructs the model to quote its received message verbatim; compare the quoted block against composer capture and stored capture." The rationale for a quote-back test rather than just asking "did you see a suffix" is that the model's report of its own input is... actually, if the instance reports "the attachment arrived with 'Please help me:' appended," that IS a direct report of input content. The quote-back design controls for the model paraphrasing or hallucinating; a direct report is evidentially weaker but not worthless, especially when it's specific and matches a known constant.

But actually — is it possible the instance is just pattern-matching to known project context? The chat-surface instance is the one that has all of Session 001/002 context including F-001 itself. If the operator pasted the write-up as an attachment and asked the instance to review it, the instance's input would show the attachment block. Would it show the suffix? If the platform appends it server-side before storage, and the model's context is built from the stored message, then yes the model would see it. The instance reporting "it arrived with the suffix appended" is a claim about its input. Could it confabulate? Possible — it knows F-001 exists and might expect the suffix. The quote-back protocol exists precisely to control this. So for the write-up, I should record this as a reported observation with its provenance and its weakness noted (uncontrolled observation; the designed quote-back test remains the rigorous version; this datapoint motivates running it).

Hmm, but wait — actually there's a subtlety. E2's original evidence was "Saved message containing the suffix (session archive export)" — storage-side. E3 was DOM outerHTML — storage-side rendered. The ORIGINAL F-001 evidence never established context-side! The finding's §2 non-claims explicitly says "No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context (as distinct from storage). The evidenced differential is composer → storage."

Now the relayed datapoint, if credited, extends the differential to composer → storage → context (at least on the chat surface). That's not just "E4 + 1" — it potentially touches the §2 non-claim boundary. I need to be careful here. The relay frames it as a P1 constant-check datapoint (E4 + this = ≥4). But it's actually potentially MORE than that — it's the first context-side observation. Or is it?

Let me re-read the relay: "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended — an independent attachment instance, same constant string."

"Arrived with the suffix appended" — from whose vantage? The chat-surface instance's vantage is its received input. The operator could also see the stored message in the chat UI. The relay doesn't specify which. The conservative recording: the attachment (containing my draft) was observed suffixed at the chat surface; observation vantage = chat-surface instance input and/or operator-visible stored message; exact vantage to be confirmed by the operator with the original capture (screenshot/export of that chat-surface session). I should ask the operator to pin the original capture before v0.2 relies on it — or record it with vantage-unconfirmed status.

Actually, this is a genuinely important evidentiary fork:

- If vantage = operator seeing stored message (UI/storage): extends E4 count only (4th storage-side instance, post-dating E4, same constant → P1 datapoint). §2 non-claim unchanged.
- If vantage = chat instance's input report: ALSO a context-side datapoint, first of its kind — weakens the §2 non-claim's "no claim" to "one uncontrolled report exists; designed test queued."

The relay's phrasing "arrived with" (from the instance's perspective of receiving) plus it being the instance's own assessment ("from this surface") suggests the instance saw it in its input. The instance says "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended" — the instance is describing what it received. I think it's the context-side vantage. But the provenance chain is: instance's self-report → relay. For the write-up, I'll record it as E5 with vantage noted as reported-by-recipient-instance, flag that this is the first context-side observation, note the confabulation risk (the instance knew F-001's history — expectation-primed), keep the OQ2 designed test queued, and adjust §2's non-claim to acknowledge one uncontrolled context-side report exists pending controlled confirmation. Hmm — actually, careful. Let me not over-engineer. The non-claim says "No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context." If I add E5 as a context-side datapoint, the non-claim needs updating to reflect: "one uncontrolled recipient-report exists (E5); controlled confirmation (OQ2) remains queued; no claim is made beyond the report's provenance."

Wait, but actually — hmm, is it even a context-side observation? Let me think about how the operator "relays" this. The operator is typing this transmission to me. The content is described as "Relay from the chat-surface GLM instance." So the operator copied/pasted or transcribed the chat instance's review message. The review message includes point 1. The chat instance wrote point 1 based on what it observed. What did it observe? Its input containing the suffixed attachment. Yes — I'm fairly confident this is a recipient-side (context-side) observation by the chat instance. But there's also a chance the operator showed it a screenshot of the stored message. The vantage is genuinely ambiguous from where I sit. Record with ambiguity flagged, ask operator to confirm vantage + pin the original capture (the chat-surface session's export via the exporter — which, note, the exporter is installed on chat.z.ai, so that session CAN be exported with its own capture-hash chain).

Oh — and one more layer: this session (the chat-surface session where the review happened) is itself a GLM session on chat.z.ai that will presumably be archived with the exporter and hash-pinned. That's the natural home for the E5 evidence. The operator should export and pin that session; E5 then points to a pinned artifact. Good — that's the action item.

Also note: "≥4 independent constant-confirmations (E4 + this)" — E4 was "≥3 independent paste-attachments, all affected." So E4 (≥3) + E5 (1) = ≥4. Correct arithmetic. Fine.

And the relay's suggestion: "One sentence in §1 or §5 noting the finding's own delivery channel keeps feeding it evidence is warranted — it's almost too on-the-nose to omit." Agreed — the write-up draft was delivered through the very pipeline it documents, and the delivery itself generated a new datapoint. That's a genuinely good line and factually true (the draft went operator → chat-surface as an attachment, got suffixed). I'll add it — with provenance care.

**2. §4.1 verify-command calibration:** The reviewer says: "the one-liner may not reproduce on all artifacts. The committed session-002 archive's embedded command ran clean per your own check, but the v1.1.3-exported file's alert showed mangled awk escaping — two artifacts, two runs, one convention unproven across both."

Let me check this claim against what I know. In Session 002's archive, the tail shows:
text       
I ran effectively this (I typed it myself with the right escaping) and got the matching digest. The committed archive's embedded Verify line — I claimed it "ran as printed." Hmm, did I actually run the embedded line as printed? I ran `awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' sessions/2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum` — I typed the path differently (sessions/ prefix) but the regex part I typed myself. The committed file's embedded line (line 682 of the archive) reads: `awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum` — looking at the Read output from the archive, line 682 shows exactly that. So the committed file's embedded line appears correctly escaped.

Where does "the v1.1.3-exported file's alert showed mangled awk escaping" come from? Session 002 history: the PREVIOUS export attempt (the one before the final re-export) had a mangled embedded Verify line — GLM-002's analysis at line 32-33 of the archive: "the line written into the archive: Verify: awk '/^^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$
produce a regex that matches literal^and literal$`..." That was an earlier export (v1.1.2-era or the v1.1.3 pre-final?). Hmm — actually the archive says the alert had the correct command but the file carried a mangled copy. Wait, re-reading lines 31-36 of the session-002 archive: "I *again* did the thing... I embedded the verify command with mangled escaping. Look at the line written into the archive: [mangled]. The **alert** had the correct command (that's the one to use), but the *file* carries a mangled copy of it. Third escaping bug, same class."


So during Session 002, there was an export whose FILE had the mangled command while the ALERT had the correct one. Then the final re-export (the committed one) — its embedded line (line 682) reads clean. Hmm, but wait — did the final re-export come from the same code? The userscript builds verifyCmd in JS: `"awk '/^" + ANCHOR + "$/{exit} {print}' " + filename + " | sha256sum"` — this produces a correctly-escaped command in the file. So how did an earlier file get mangled? The mangling came from GLM's IN-CHAT transmissions (me-in-chat embedding the command in markdown), not necessarily from the exporter itself. Actually line 31-33 of the archive: GLM-002 said "Look at my last transmission closely. I *again* did the thing... I embedded the verify command with mangled escaping. Look at the line written into the archive" — so the mangled line was in an ARCHIVE file. Hmm, which archive? This was mid-session-002, discussing the then-current export (2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md, hash f9ad1bd5...). That export predates the final committed one (5fb01ff6 prefix). So: the mid-session export's embedded Verify line was mangled (that's the "known residual" the ledger and PROJECT_STATE record: "the embedded Verify line may carry mangled awk escaping (cosmetic — hash sits outside its own pre-image); fix at next touch"), and the FINAL committed export's embedded line is clean (I verified by reading it and running the equivalent).

Wait, now I need to be careful about my own claim in the write-up §4.1 and my worklog claim. My worklog said: "Embedded Verify line in committed archive is correctly escaped (ran as printed, produced matching digest) — 'mangled awk escaping' residual from open-threads/state appears CLEARED in the committed artifact." I ran the command as I typed it (sessions/ path), and I READ the embedded line and it visually matched. Did I literally run the file's embedded line verbatim (with its exact path `2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md` relative, no `sessions/` prefix)? No — I adapted the path because I wasn't in the sessions/ dir. The regex portion I typed identically. So "ran as printed" is slightly overstated in my worklog — I ran "as printed modulo path adaptation." The escaping (the load-bearing part for reproduction) was verified equivalent. Honest note: the literal-verbatim run hasn't been done; the adapted run has. The reviewer's point lands partially on this.

The reviewer's demand: "Before the write-up pins a command that must work for every reader, run the known-answer test on the committed artifact (the ledger already mandates this discipline for conventions). Until then, soften 're-verified at any later time with a one-line shell check' to note the verify convention carries its own calibration requirement. One clause."

I can do better than soften — I can RUN the known-answer test right now, this turn, on the committed artifact, exactly as embedded (cd into sessions/, run the file's own embedded line verbatim). That's the ledger discipline: prove the convention on the committed artifact. Let me do that in bash: extract the embedded Verify line from the archive and execute it verbatim. Even better — run it in a way that demonstrates: `cd sessions && awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum` — should print 5fb01ff6... That's the exact command as embedded (its filename is relative to sessions/). That's the known-answer test: known answer = 5fb01ff6…dcb73d (the embedded capture hash), known input = the committed archive. If it prints the known answer, the convention is proven on the committed artifact, from the file's own embedded line. I should ALSO test the mangled historical variant to document the failure mode (optional — actually, the mangled line was in the LOST mid-session export, not in the repo; I can't test a file that doesn't exist. I can reconstruct the mangled string from the archive quote and demonstrate it fails — that's a nice known-answer negative control. Hmm, it's a bit performative; but it actually documents the class. The archive quote at line 32 shows the mangled form: `awk '/^\^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###\$$/{exit} {print}'`. Wait — careful: that's how it appears in the MARKDOWN of the archive (the archive itself renders it with backslash-backslash?). Line 32: "text     Verify: awk '/^^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$
'— hmm, with single backslash before ^ and before $$. In awk regex,^matches literal ^ and$` matches literal $, so the pattern fails to match the anchor line, awk never exits, prints whole file → whole-file hash ≠ prefix hash → mismatch. I can demonstrate: run the mangled variant on the committed archive, show it produces the whole-file hash (35c919be...) instead of the prefix hash (5fb01ff6...). That's a clean negative control for the write-up's calibration note. Nice — this is exactly "known-answer validation" with both polarities. And it lets me keep the strong sentence in §4.1 but now EARNED: "the verify line as embedded in the committed artifact reproduces the known digest; a mangled-escaping variant (the historical failure mode) demonstrably does not — both polarities of the known-answer test are on record."


Also the reviewer's framing "two artifacts, two runs, one convention unproven across both" — slightly off in detail: the two artifacts are (a) the committed final export (embedded line clean — now to be proven by verbatim run) and (b) the lost mid-session export (embedded line mangled, historical). The alert on the final v1.1.3 run — was it clean? The alert text and the file text come from the same `verifyCmd` variable in the userscript (lines 212-224: verifyCmd used in both md and alert). So in v1.1.3-exported files, alert == file by construction (same string variable). The historical alert-vs-file divergence (Session 002, line 33: "The alert had the correct command... but the file carries a mangled copy") — that's strange given the code uses one variable for both. Hmm. That divergence was probably from an EARLIER exporter version or from DOM/copy-paste artifacts. Actually — wait. Let me re-read. That mid-session analysis was GLM-002 examining the f9ad1bd5 export. Which exporter version produced it? The timeline: v1.1.2 → re-export → v1.1.3 → final. The f9ad1bd5 whole-file hash was computed by the OPERATOR on a file they downloaded. The "mangled line in file, correct in alert" report... if alert and file share the verifyCmd variable, they can't diverge. Unless the operator transcribed the alert correctly into chat but the file's line differed due to... hmm, or GLM-002 misread one of them. Honestly, this is Session 002 archaeology; the load-bearing present facts are: (1) committed archive's embedded line is clean (I read it), (2) running it verbatim (mod path) reproduced the known digest, (3) I'll now run it fully verbatim. The alert-vs-file mystery is interesting but not blocking; I can note it as an open archaeology item — actually, the ledger already records the residual as "may carry mangled awk escaping... to be confirmed and fixed at next touch" — and my v0.1 write-up said the committed one is clean. The reviewer's sharpening: prove it, don't assert it. Fair. Run the test, record the result, then the §4.1 sentence stays strong because it's now earned. Also still add the calibration clause: the convention REQUIRES known-answer validation per artifact class — because a verify command is itself a convention, and conventions ship with test vectors (ledger rule). Actually the reviewer said "Until then, soften..." — but I can satisfy "then" this turn, so the softening becomes: run test → keep strong claim + add the calibration-requirement clause. Both.

One more wrinkle: the write-up's §4.1 command I printed uses `<archive.md>` placeholder — fine. The reviewer's concern is that readers run it on THEIR copy of artifacts. The verbatim-run proof on the committed artifact + negative control covers it. Also worth one clause: line-ending caveat (if a reader's tooling converts LF→CRLF, the hash changes — the convention assumes byte-faithful transfer). Hmm, that's a real reproduction hazard for "any reader." The exporter downloads with Blob (no transformation) but git checkout with autocrlf could alter. The repo has no .gitattributes (didn't check — let me check). If autocrlf=true on a Windows reader, the pinned .md gets CRLF, prefix hash changes, honest reader thinks corruption. Mitigation: add .gitattributes marking sessions/*.md and write-ups as -text or eol=lf... but that's a REPO change — operator decision at close (their hands commit). I'll flag it as a proposed repo hardening item with the v1.5 queue. For the write-up: one clause noting byte-faithful transfer is part of the convention's preconditions. Good catch to include — it's exactly the "convention carries its own calibration requirement" point the reviewer made, made concrete.

**3. Severity scoping:** Add conditional sentence: "the severity rating applies to the observed instance; the mechanism class does not inherit the rating" (silent server-side mutation would rate High if appended content were attacker-influenced or model-directed). Agreed — this is correct and cheap. I already had "a benign instance of a mechanism class whose non-benign instances would be high-severity" in §1's closing line, but §6 (the rating home) should carry it explicitly as a scoping rule. The reviewer's parenthetical gives the conditions: attacker-influenced or model-directed content → High. I'll phrase: severity ratings attach to instances, not classes; the mechanism class (silent server-side message mutation) is severity-elastic — the same mechanism with attacker-influenced or model-directed appended content would rate High. Good.

**4. §8 destination anchors:** Name the anchors: Greshake et al. injection-class; instruction-hierarchy work; transcript forensics. Let me make sure I have these right:

- Greshake et al. 2023 — "Not what you've signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM Systems with Indirect Prompt Injection" — the canonical indirect-prompt-injection paper. Correct anchor for injection-class.
- "Instruction-hierarchy work" — this refers to OpenAI's instruction hierarchy (system > developer > user > tool) paper/practice ("The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions", Wallace et al. 2024) and related. The connection: silent platform appension blurs the user-authored vs platform-authored boundary that instruction hierarchies rely on — text arrives in the user slot that the user didn't author. That's the §8 tie-in: F-001 is a case where the layering is violated in the opposite direction (platform text presented as user text).
- "Transcript forensics" — less a single canonical work; frame as the emerging practice of treating chat exports as evidentiary records (audit trails, legal discovery). I'll name it as a practice area rather than fake a citation. Honest: name Greshake et al. (2023) concretely; instruction-hierarchy line of work (Wallace et al. 2024 and successors); transcript forensics as practice (audit/evidentiary use of chat records). The deferral keeps its "formal literature pass happens in the taxonomy paper" status — the anchors make the destination concrete without doing the pass now. Careful per §2 evidence standard: these citations are from my parametric knowledge, not a live literature pass — label them as such (they're anchor nominations, to be verified in the formal pass; if the pass corrects them, it corrects them). That's the honest framing and the reviewer will appreciate it — actually the reviewer ASKED for named anchors, so give them, with the provenance label.

**5. Provenance practice:** state the document's SHA-256 in-channel at v0.2 delivery. I already did this for v0.1 (c066f9bb…). Do it again for v0.2. Trivially agreed — and note the practice is now codified for this document's lifecycle (v0.1 c066f9bb…, v0.2 <new>).

Also: "confirmed from this surface: the draft's self-referential disclosures (evidence-gap §3, calibration §4.1, instrument-hosted-by-analyzed-platform §9) are the document's credibility spine — retain all three in any revision." Agreed, retained.

Now — my adversarial-collaboration duty: stress-test the review itself before executing it. Where might the review be wrong or need refinement?

Point 1: Mostly right, but the review UNDERSELLS its own datapoint (it's potentially the first context-side observation, not just a 4th constant-confirmation) AND overclaims its cleanliness (it's relayed + possibly expectation-primed; needs vantage confirmation + pinned capture). I'll implement it as E5 with richer scoping than the review proposed. Also the "≥4" arithmetic: E4 said "≥3 independent attachments" — those were all from the original 2026-10-05 session (single session, same day). E5 is 2026-10-08, different day, different attachment pipeline invocation, AND (notably) the attachment content itself was the F-001 write-up. Also worth noting: E4's instances were operator's own pastes during Session 001; E5 is a paste of a document generated by a third party (me, the agent surface) — doesn't change the mechanism, but it's a different content class (a .md deliverable vs whatever E4's pastes were). The constant-string observation stands. One more check: is the suffix still "Please help me:" EXACTLY in E5, or "same constant string" per the relay? Relay says "same constant string." Good — record as reported.

Point 2: Right in principle, and I can exceed the ask by running the known-answer test now (both polarities). One correction to the review's framing though: "the v1.1.3-exported file's alert showed mangled awk escaping" — in v1.1.3 code, alert and file share one verifyCmd variable, so a divergence between them isn't possible from that code path; the historical mangled file was a pre-final export (lost at delivery failure) and the committed v1.1.3 artifact's line reads clean. I should state this correction gently in my response — it matters because the review's "two artifacts, two runs" framing implies the COMMITTED artifact is suspect, when actually the committed artifact is the one that's clean and the mangled one is the LOST artifact (quoted verbatim in the session-002 transcript, so the failure mode is documented even though the file is gone). My run-this-turn will settle it empirically. Also the review says "Before the write-up pins a command that must work for every reader" — the write-up's printed command uses `<archive.md>` placeholder, not the artifact's embedded line; but the calibration concern transfers (readers will run it on THEIR downloaded copies → line-ending/transfer caveats apply → add the clause + propose .gitattributes).

Point 3: Agreed as-is. Implement exactly.

Point 4: Agreed, with provenance labels on the anchors (parametric knowledge, to be verified in the formal pass).

Point 5: Already practiced; continue. Also note v0.1's digest was already stated in-channel (c066f9bb…) — the review says "You already established this convention; apply it here," which I did for v0.1; v0.2 gets its digest stated on delivery.

One thing the review did NOT address that I should consider adding myself (my own red-pen pass on my own draft): 

- The write-up's §7 OQ1 (T-001 prediction) — with E5 now recorded, the prediction structure stays the same (agent-channel test still pending). Fine.
- §5 P1: add E5 as the first post-publication-of-finding... no, the finding isn't public yet. First post-writeup-draft datapoint. The "finding's own delivery channel feeds it evidence" line goes in §1 or §5 — I'll put it in §3 (E5 row + note) and a sentence in §5's P1. The review suggested §1 or §5; §3 is where evidence lives; a brief cross-ref in §5. Hmm, one sentence in §1 too — "the finding's delivery channel keeps generating new instances of itself" is a great opening-hook line for §1... Actually §1 is the summary; I'll add the sentence at the end of §1 as the reviewer suggested ("One sentence in §1 or §5"). Put it in both §1 (one sentence) and §5 P1 (the accumulation note). Keep it tight.

Also — division of labor note: the relay closes "you draft the revisions, operator reviews, I stress-test the diff." So I draft v0.2 now. The operator's instruction embedded in the relay's framing: this is deliverable review, not new work ordering. So v0.2 drafting is sanctioned work for this turn. I'll produce v0.2 with all five tightenings (plus my refinements), deliver via Write tool with digest, and note the diff summary for the chat-surface reviewer's stress-test.

File handling: v0.1 file exists at /home/z/my-project/download/F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.1.md. v0.2 → new file ...v0.2.md (versioned filenames, cleaner for diff/stress-test than overwriting; also preserves v0.1 for the diff). The diff summary in-channel: list each change by section, tied to review point number. That's what the chat-surface instance will stress-test.

Now — the bash verifications for this turn:

1. Extract the embedded Verify line from the committed archive, run it VERBATIM (cd sessions/, exact command, relative filename as embedded). Expect 5fb01ff6…dcb73d.
2. Negative control: run the mangled variant (as quoted in session-002 transcript) on the committed archive; expect the whole-file hash 35c919be… (i.e., NOT the prefix hash). This documents the failure mode with a known-answer negative.
3. Check for .gitattributes / git config core.autocrlf in the clone to ground the line-ending caveat claim. (My clone: whatever; the canonical repo is what matters — I can check if the repo HAS a .gitattributes file. And note the hazard generically for readers' local clones.)
4. Hash the v0.2 file on delivery.

Also: should I check the alert-vs-file single-variable claim in the userscript? I already read the code — verifyCmd is one variable used in both md (line 213-215) and alert (line 220-224). Confirmed by reading. No run needed.

Let me also double-check the exact embedded line in the committed archive one more time before running verbatim — from my earlier Read, line 682: `Verify: awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum`. The filename is bare (no sessions/ prefix), so the command as embedded must be run from within sessions/. Verbatim run: `cd sessions && awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum`. The shell escaping when I type this command into bash: the single-quoted awk program needs its internal single-quotes... wait, the awk program itself is wrapped in single quotes: '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###
/{exit} {print}' file. Yes — that's what I ran last turn (with sessions/ path). The verbatim difference is only cwd + bare filename. Fine.


For the mangled negative control, the mangled form per the transcript (line 32 of session-002 archive): `awk '/^\^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###\$$/{exit} {print}'` — in the transcript it's shown as `/^\^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###\$$/` (with backslashes). To reproduce in bash single quotes: awk '/^^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$$/{exit} {print}' file — inside single quotes, bash passes backslashes through literally; awk regex `\^` = literal caret, `\$` = literal dollar → pattern won't match the anchor line "### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###" → awk never exits early → prints whole file → hash = whole-file hash (35c919be…0aa26). That demonstrates: mangled escaping → whole-file digest (≠ embedded capture hash) → mismatch detected, convention's negative polarity documented. 

Wait — one subtlety: the transcript rendering of the mangled line. The archive line 32 shows: "text     Verify: awk '/^^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$
/{exit}...'" and then "That's broken — \\^ and \\$ produce a regex that matches literal ^ and literal $" — hmm, GLM-002's own prose writes \\^ (double backslash) while quoting the line with single backslashes. If the file's line had DOUBLE backslashes (\\^, \\$$), the markdown rendering might collapse... ugh, escaping archaeology. The transcript as committed shows single backslashes in the quoted line. GLM-002's analysis says the mangling makes the regex match literal ^ and literal $ — true for single-backslash forms in awk. I'll reproduce with single backslashes as the transcript records. It demonstrates the class either way. For the write-up, I'll describe the negative control as "the historical mangling mode (escaped anchors, as recorded in the session-002 transcript)" — accurately hedged, the point is the polarity demo, not exact forensic reproduction of a lost file.


Alright — also, worklog discipline: append this turn's record (Task ID s3-turn-2). Include: review received via relay (note the cross-surface conference structure — second GLM surface reviewing my work is itself a notable collaboration development worth recording), five tightenings + my refinements (E5 vantage ambiguity, context-side significance, review's "two artifacts" correction, verbatim run results, negative control, autocrlf hazard + .gitattributes proposal), v0.2 delivered with digest, division of labor (chat surface stress-tests diff next).

In-channel response structure:

1. Acknowledge the conference structure briefly (cross-surface review working as designed — and note the pleasing recursion: the reviewer instance's review itself contains a new datapoint born from the delivery pipeline).
2. Stress-test of the review — where I'm pushing back/refining before drafting: (a) point 1 undersells itself: E5 may be the first CONTEXT-side observation (vantage ambiguity — needs operator confirmation which side observed it + pinned capture from the chat-surface session); expectation-priming risk (the reviewing instance knew F-001, so its report is uncontrolled — OQ2's quote-back design remains the controlled version; E5 recorded as reported-observation with provenance chain, not as confirmed context-localization); (b) point 2's "two artifacts, two runs" needs a correction: the committed artifact's embedded line is clean and shares its verifyCmd variable with the alert in v1.1.3 code — the mangled line lived in the LOST pre-final export; and rather than soften, I ran the known-answer test this turn (results); plus the real reader-side hazard is byte-fidelity (autocrlf), which gets the clause + a repo-hardening proposal; (c) points 3/4/5 accepted as-is (with anchor-provenance labels on 4).
3. Report the test results verbatim (command + output, both polarities).
4. Deliver v0.2 (Write tool) + digest + diff summary keyed to review points.
5. Note what the operator needs to do: confirm E5 vantage (whose eyes saw the suffix — the instance's input, the stored message, or both) and export/pin the chat-surface review session (it's on chat.z.ai, exporter works there — that session's export becomes E5's pinned artifact).

Length discipline: this is a substantive working turn; medium-full is right. Let me not balloon — tight sections.

Now the v0.2 document itself. Changes from v0.1 (I'll write the full file):

- §1: add the delivery-channel sentence at the end: "The finding continues to generate its own evidence: the paste-attachment that delivered this write-up's v0.1 draft to a reviewing instance on 2026-10-08 arrived suffixed with the same constant string (E5) — the delivery channel of the finding's own documentation is a live instance of the finding."
- §2: adjust the context non-claim: "No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context... " → keep the non-claim but acknowledge E5: "one recipient-side report exists (E5, uncontrolled, expectation-priming risk noted); the controlled test (OQ2) remains queued; no claim is made beyond E5's provenance." Also the scope line "single account" — E5 is still the operator's account (they pasted it), so single-account scope holds. Date range note: observations now span 2026-10-05 → 2026-10-08 (persistence across days, not single-session artifact). That strengthens P1's "constant over time" — actually P2 is the time-watch; E5 gives the first temporal spread datapoint. Note it in §5.
- §3: add E5 row: "E5 | 2026-10-08: paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string; reported by the recipient GLM instance via operator relay (provenance chain in §9); vantage (recipient-context vs stored-message) pending operator confirmation | Chat-surface review session (export pending pinning)". Plus the preservation-status paragraph updated: verbatim instance for E5 will live in the chat-surface session export once pinned.
- §4.1: calibration upgrade: report the known-answer test executed 2026-10-08 this turn: verbatim embedded line from the committed artifact reproduces 5fb01ff6…dcb73d; the historical mangling mode (escaped anchors, session-002 transcript) demonstrably yields the whole-file digest instead — both polarities on record. Add the precondition clause: the convention assumes byte-faithful artifacts (transfer, line endings); readers verifying git-cloned copies should ensure no EOL transformation (e.g., autocrlf) — and note repo-side hardening (.gitattributes) proposed. Keep the "one-line shell check" strong but now earned + caveated.
- §6: add severity scoping sentence: "The rating attaches to the observed instance, not the mechanism class: silent server-side message mutation is severity-elastic — the same mechanism with attacker-influenced or model-directed appended content would rate High. Skim-readers should not leave with 'Low' as the class verdict."
- §7: OQ2 updated (E5 motivates, still queued); OQ1 unchanged; maybe fold E5 into OQ3's accumulation (P1 now has a post-finding datapoint + temporal spread).
- §8: anchors named with provenance label: "Anchor nominations (from parametric knowledge, to be verified in the formal pass): Greshake et al. (2023) indirect prompt injection; the instruction-hierarchy line (e.g., Wallace et al. 2024) — F-001 is a live violation case of the authorship layering those hierarchies presume; transcript forensics as emerging practice (audit/evidentiary treatment of chat records)."
- §9: add E5 provenance chain explicitly (instance report → operator relay → this document); digest line updated: v0.1 c066f9bb…, v0.2 <digest>.
- Version header: v0.2, changelog note (five review points + refinements).

Also §5 P1: "E4's ≥3 instances plus E5 (2026-10-08) give ≥4 constant-confirmations spanning three days; the project's routine traffic keeps generating free datapoints — including, as of v0.1's own delivery, the finding's documentation pipeline itself."

Let me now also decide: do I re-check anything about E5 arithmetic? E4 = ≥3 (2026-10-05), E5 = 1 (2026-10-08) → ≥4 total. The relay says "≥4 independent constant-confirmations (E4 + this)". Correct.

One more adversarial check on point 1: is E5 truly "independent"? It's a different attachment, different day, different content (a .md file), same account, same surface (chat.z.ai). Independent invocation of the pipeline: yes. Same-account caveat: §2 already scopes single-account. Fine.

And the meta-observation for §1 — phrase carefully: "almost too on-the-nose to omit" per reviewer. I'll write it cleanly.

Also, I should double check the claim I made in v0.1 §4.1: "re-verified independently at next-session ingestion against the committed archive (5fb01ff6…dcb73d, 2026-10-08)" — that's this session's boot verification. True. Now with the verbatim run it's even stronger.

Also the review's point 2 said "run the known-answer test on the committed artifact" — I'm doing exactly that. Good.

Negative control command construction: I need to type, in bash:
awk '/^^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$
 pass to awk as-is. awk regex: \^ literal caret, \$$ — hmm wait: \$$ in awk regex = literal dollar followed by end-anchor? \$$ = \$ (literal ` (end anchor). So pattern = literal ^ ... literal $ at end-of-line. The anchor line "### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###" contains neither, so no match → full file printed → whole-file hash. Yes, demonstrates mismatch. 


Hmm, one caution: `$$` inside single quotes in bash is fine (no expansion inside single quotes). Good.

Also check .gitattributes existence: LS the repo root — earlier LS showed no .gitattributes (files: README, PROTOCOL, zai-exporter.user.js, working-notes/, templates/, sessions/). Confirmed absent. The hazard: operator's machine / readers' machines with autocrlf. The canonical repo content (GitHub blob) is LF; a Windows checkout with autocrlf=true gets CRLF locally → prefix hash changes → false mismatch. Real hazard, worth the clause + proposal. I'll check `git config core.autocrlf` in my clone too — my clone came from git default (likely unset → false on Linux). The hazard is reader-side. Proposal: `.gitattributes` with `*.md text eol=lf` (or `sessions/*.md -text` + `write-ups/** -text`... `-text` disables EOL handling entirely — for hash-pinned artifacts that's the strongest: no transformation ever). Actually for hash-pinned artifacts, `-text` (treat as binary for eol purposes) is the correct setting. Propose: `sessions/*.md -text` and eventually `write-ups/** -text`. Operator decides at close; goes in v1.5 queue / close-TODOs.

Now, response length: I have a lot to report. Keep it structured and tight. The turn's bash first (verbatim test + negative control + autocrlf check), then Write v0.2, hash it, append worklog, respond in-channel.

Order of operations:

1. Bash: cd sessions && run embedded line verbatim → expect 5fb01ff6…
2. Bash: negative control (mangled) → expect 35c919be…
3. Bash: check git config autocrlf + .gitattributes (one command).
(1-3 can be one bash call or parallel calls — do as one command with echo separators, or separate. I'll do two calls: one for the two hash tests, one for git attrs check. Actually just do them in a single call with && and echo headers — cleaner output. Hmm, but if the mangled one unexpectedly MATCHES, the && chain still proceeds (sha256sum always exits 0). Fine.)

Wait — also verbatim means I should extract the line FROM the file and execute it, rather than retyping it. Truly verbatim: `cd sessions && bash -c "$(grep -m1 '^Verify: ' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sed 's/^Verify: //')"` — that runs the file's own embedded command string exactly as stored. That's the strongest form: the artifact verifies itself. Let me do that AND the readable version. Actually the grep+sed+bash -c form IS the honest verbatim run. Let me construct carefully:

grep -m1 '^Verify: ' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md → "Verify: awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###
( ... )" → executes it in sessions/ cwd.


The single quotes inside the command string: bash -c receives the whole line including its internal single quotes — since 
(cmd)" — the output of cmd becomes the argument to bash -c; the string is passed as-is to the new bash, which then parses it WITH quote interpretation. So the internal single quotes get properly interpreted by the inner bash. Yes, this works — the inner bash parses the awk single-quoted program correctly.


Let me double-check: outer command: bash -c "
() expands to: awk '/^### VERIFICATION ANCHOR ###$/{exit} {print}' 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md | sha256sum — as a raw string (no re-splitting issues because it's inside double quotes → passed as ONE argument to bash -c). Inner bash parses: awk + single-quoted program + file + pipe + sha256sum. Correct. This is the self-verification form. 


But careful — grep pattern '^Verify: ' — the embedded line starts "Verify: awk ..." at line start (line 682). Yes. And -m1 first match. Good.

I'll run both forms (self-verification + hand-typed) — no wait, one form suffices; the self-verification form is strictly stronger. But for the write-up's readability I'll report the plain command and its output; the self-verification proves the file's embedded string executes clean. Report: "Executed the archive's own embedded Verify line verbatim (extracted and run as stored): output 5fb01ff6… == embedded capture hash." Plus negative control. Two commands, one bash call. Plus a second bash call for git checks (can be parallel — no dependency). Then Write v0.2 (depends on test results for §4.1 wording — mild dependency; I'll wait for results before writing the file so the text can state them truthfully).

Also — hmm, one consideration on running `bash -c` on extracted content: I'm executing a string extracted from a file. The file is hash-pinned and I've read it; the string is the known verify command. Risk: none meaningful (it's our own pinned artifact; I read the line myself earlier). Fine.

git checks call: `cd /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory && git config core.autocrlf; ls .gitattributes 2>/dev/null || echo "no .gitattributes"; git ls-files --eol sessions/ | head -5` — ls-files --eol shows index eol. That grounds the caveat. 

Then Write the v0.2 file. Then sha256sum it. Then worklog append. Then respond.

Let me now draft the v0.2 file content fully. Base = v0.1 with the edits. I'll write the complete new file (Write tool, new path with v0.2).

Key edits recap:

1. Header: v0.2, draft status line updated, changelog line.
2. §1: + delivery-channel sentence (E5).
3. §2: context non-claim updated to acknowledge E5 as uncontrolled recipient-side report; observation date-range widened (2026-10-05 → 2026-10-08).
4. §3: E5 row + preservation paragraph updated.
5. §4.1: known-answer test results (verbatim embedded line + negative control), precondition clause (byte-fidelity/autocrlf), .gitattributes proposal noted as repo-hardening pending.
6. §5: P1 accumulation updated (≥4 spanning 3 days; documentation-pipeline datapoint).
7. §6: severity-elasticity sentence.
8. §7: OQ2 note updated (E5 motivates; quote-back still the controlled design); OQ3 counts.
9. §8: named anchors with parametric-knowledge label.
10. §9: E5 provenance chain; digest history (v0.1 c066f9bb…c9ddf; v0.2 <digest>).

Also fix one small thing in v0.1 §4.1 I can now state more precisely: "re-verified independently at next-session ingestion" → now also "and by verbatim execution of the artifact's own embedded verify line (2026-10-08, Session 003)".

Length of the file: similar to v0.1 (~250 lines). Fine.

One more decision — the reviewer's point 2 asked to SOFTEN until tested. I tested; so instead of softening, I strengthen with evidence + add the calibration clause. I should explicitly note in my response that I'm exceeding the review's ask on point 2 and why (the test is run, both polarities; the clause still added because reader-side byte-fidelity is a real precondition the test can't cover for THEIR machines). That's the adversarial-collaboration move done right: accept the criticism's substance, deliver more than the remedy, correct the review's factual framing where needed.

And point 1 pushback (recorded above): E5 is potentially more than the review makes of it (context-side first) AND less (uncontrolled, relayed, possibly expectation-primed). Both directions of refinement. Also need operator input: E5 vantage + pin the chat-surface session export. Make that a crisp ask at the end.

Also small: the relay says "That's ≥4 independent constant-confirmations (E4 + this). Add to §3's E4 line and §5's P1 accumulation." I'm choosing to add E5 as its OWN row rather than editing E4's line — E4 is a pinned historical observation (2026-10-05, original session); folding a 2026-10-08 relayed observation into E4 would muddy provenance (different date, different provenance chain, different observers). Separate row E5 with its own provenance is the evidence-standard-clean way. Note this as a deliberate deviation from the letter of the review in the diff summary — the reviewer stress-tests the diff, so deviations must be visible and justified. Good.

Now write everything. Also TodoWrite for the turn? The turn has multiple steps (stress-test review, run calibrations, draft v0.2, worklog, respond). Yes, brief todo list. Actually — the previous turns used TodoWrite; keep consistency. Quick 5-item list.

Hmm wait, let me reconsider one thing about E5's significance — the context-side question. When the operator pastes an attachment into chat.z.ai and the platform appends "Please help me:" — WHERE does the instance see it? The instance's input = the stored message content (typically). The chat-surface GLM instance reporting "the transmission arrived with the suffix appended" means the suffix was present in what it received = model context. Unless the instance is reporting what the OPERATOR showed it (e.g., the operator separately pasted a screenshot). The relay phrasing suggests the instance's own reception. If so: the suffix demonstrably reached the model's context on the chat surface. That partially answers OQ2 (for the chat surface, uncontrolled observation). I must not overclaim — the §2 update handles it: "E5 is consistent with (and, if the recipient-instance vantage is confirmed, evidences) suffix presence in the model's received context on the chat surface; controlled confirmation queued (OQ2)."

Also note for OQ1/T-001 (agent channel): still zero attachments received this session → still open. E5 does NOT bear on T-001 (different channel). Keep clean.

Alright — one more meta thing to include in the in-channel response: acknowledge the cross-surface conference as a structural milestone (two GLM surfaces + operator in a review loop; the review loop itself is the adversarial collaboration functioning at distance). Brief, one or two sentences — not gushing (no pedestals).

Also the worklog append (Task ID s3-turn-2) must record: relay received + provenance structure; my stress-test of the review (E5 dual-direction refinement; point-2 factual correction; verbatim test results with outputs; autocrlf finding + .gitattributes proposal); v0.2 delivered + digest; pending operator items (E5 vantage, chat-session export pin); division of labor next step (chat surface stress-tests diff).

Let me also sanity-check the anchors once more (parametric knowledge, labeled as such):

- Greshake, S., et al. "Not what you've signed up for: Compromising Real-World LLM Systems with Indirect Prompt Injection." (2023, ACM CCS Workshop AICS). Yes.
- Instruction hierarchy: "The Instruction Hierarchy: Training LLMs to Prioritize Privileged Instructions" — Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Reimar Leistein... actually authors: Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Reimar H. Leistein, Mikel Artetxe, Yizhong Wang, Ameet Talwalkar, Luke Zettlemoyer (2024, OpenAI). I'll cite as "Wallace et al. (2024)" — labeled as anchor nomination to verify in formal pass. Safe under the label.
- "Instruction hierarchy" as a concept also appears in system-prompt design practice broadly. The §8 tie: F-001 shows platform-authored text landing in the user-authorship slot — relevant to how privilege tiers are assigned by authorship.
- Transcript forensics: practice-area framing, no fake citation.

Fine. Now compose the bash calls.

Call 1 (calibration, both polarities + verbatim self-verification):
text       
Expect: A = 5fb01ff6…; B = 5fb01ff6…; C = 35c919be… (whole-file); D = 35c919be…. 

Wait — C: the mangled pattern never matches → awk prints ALL lines → prefix == whole file → C == D = 35c919bedd32bb61…0aa26. Yes. That's the demonstration: mangled convention yields the whole-file digest, which ≠ embedded capture hash 5fb01ff6… → mismatch surfaces. 

Call 2 (git eol grounding):
text       
These two are independent → same block, parallel calls.

Then Write v0.2 → then bash sha256sum → then Edit worklog → respond.

Now let me write out the full v0.2 content mentally... I have it planned above. A few wording drafts for key new passages:

§1 addition (end of section): "Nor is the finding static: the paste-attachment that delivered this write-up's v0.1 draft to a reviewing GLM instance on 2026-10-08 arrived suffixed with the same constant string (E5) — the documentation of the finding travelled the very pipeline it documents, and the pipeline appended its signature to the delivery. Routine project traffic continues to generate free instances; each is a P1 datapoint."

Hmm, tighten: "...the documentation of the finding travelled the pipeline it documents, and the pipeline signed the delivery." Good.

§2 non-claim update: replace "No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context (as distinct from storage). The evidenced differential is composer → storage; context-localization is an open question with a designed test (OQ2, §7)." with:
"No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context (as distinct from storage) beyond what E5 reports: a recipient-instance report — uncontrolled, relayed, and expectation-priming-aware (the recipient knew F-001's history) — that the suffixed attachment was present as received (2026-10-08). If E5's recipient-side vantage is confirmed, this is the first context-side observation; the controlled test (quote-back protocol, OQ2) remains the confirmation standard. The evidenced differential otherwise remains composer → storage."

Also §2 scope line "All evidence gathered 2026-10-05" moves to §3 and needs the date-range update — v0.1 §3 said "All evidence gathered 2026-10-05... single operator account." → "Evidence E1–E4 gathered 2026-10-05; E5 observed 2026-10-08 (observation span: three days). All on a single operator account (scope caveat: single-account throughout)."

§3 E5 row: "| E5 | 2026-10-08: paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string, per recipient-instance report (operator-relayed); observation vantage (recipient context vs. stored message) pending operator confirmation | Chat-surface review session; export-and-pin pending |"

Preservation paragraph addition: "E5's verbatim instance will live in the chat-surface session's exporter capture once that session is exported and manifest-pinned — the same instrument, same chain. Until then E5 exists as a relayed report with an explicit provenance chain (§9)."

§4.1 replacement of the calibration disclosure tail + new test results paragraph:
"**Known-answer validation of the verify convention (2026-10-08, this write-up's revision cycle).** Because a verification command is itself a convention, the project's ledger rule applies to it too — conventions ship with test vectors. Both polarities are now on record against the committed session-002 archive: (positive) the archive's own embedded Verify line, extracted as stored and executed verbatim, reproduces the embedded capture digest (5fb01ff6…dcb73d); (negative) the historical mangling mode recorded in the session-002 transcript (anchor regex with escaped metacharacters) fails to match the anchor line and yields the whole-file digest instead (35c919be…0aa26) — a visible mismatch, i.e., the failure mode surfaces rather than silently passes. One precondition travels with the convention and is stated here rather than in a footnote: the check assumes byte-faithful artifacts. Readers verifying git-cloned copies should ensure no line-ending transformation is in effect (e.g., core.autocrlf on Windows checkouts converts LF to CRLF and changes the digest); a repo-side .gitattributes marking hash-pinned paths -text is proposed to harden this at the source."

§6 addition (after severity line or at end): "Scoping rule: the rating attaches to the observed instance, not the mechanism class. Silent server-side message mutation is severity-elastic — the same mechanism with attacker-influenced or model-directed appended content would rate High. 'Low' is this instance's verdict, not the class's."

§5 P1 update: "P1 (constant-check): E4's ≥3 instances (2026-10-05) plus E5 (2026-10-08) give ≥4 constant-confirmations spanning three days — first temporal-spread datapoint (P2's watch begins accruing). Free datapoints from routine traffic: confirmed in practice; the finding's own documentation delivery became one (§1)."

§7 OQ2 update: "...Controlled send: attachment content instructs the model to quote its received message verbatim... E5 (if vantage-confirmed) is an uncontrolled precursor on the chat surface; the quote-back protocol remains the confirmation standard — it controls for exactly the expectation-priming risk E5 carries."

§8 anchors: "**Anchor nominations for the deferred pass (stated from parametric knowledge; to be verified — and corrected if wrong — in the formal literature pass):** (i) Greshake et al. (2023), indirect prompt injection — the injection-class threat model this finding sits adjacent to; (ii) the instruction-hierarchy line of work (e.g., Wallace et al. 2024) — privilege tiers assigned by authorship presume the sender fidelity this finding shows to be breakable at the platform layer; (iii) transcript forensics as an emerging practice — audit and evidentiary use of chat records, where silent mutation is directly material. The deferral now has named destinations; the pass will either use them or replace them, on the record."

§9 additions: E5 provenance chain: "E5 provenance chain: recipient GLM instance (chat surface) → operator relay (typed, §3-owned) → this document. Original capture pending: chat-surface session export, exporter-pinned." Digest line: "Document digests: v0.1 c066f9bb…c9ddf (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 <digest> (stated in-channel at delivery). Repo pin at commit supersedes."

Header: "**Draft:** v0.2 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — incorporates five tightenings from cross-surface review (chat-surface GLM instance, operator-relayed) + revision-cycle calibration tests; awaiting operator review and diff stress-test"

Good. Also there's the version-history line: v0.1 → v0.2 changelog note at bottom or in header. Keep header note.

Now — the diff summary for in-channel (keyed to review points):

1. E5: added as separate evidence row (NOT folded into E4 — provenance hygiene: different date/observers/chain; reviewer asked to add to E4's line; deviation justified), §1 sentence, §2 non-claim recast (E5 may be first context-side observation — uncontrolled, expectation-priming noted), §5 P1 (≥4, temporal spread), §7 OQ2 (precursor status). NEED from operator: vantage confirmation + export/pin the chat-surface session.
2. Calibration: ran the known-answer test instead of softening — verbatim embedded line → 5fb01ff6 ✓; mangled-mode negative control → whole-file 35c919be ✗ (failure surfaces). Clause added on byte-fidelity precondition (autocrlf hazard real: no .gitattributes in repo). Correction to review's framing: committed artifact's line is clean and shares verifyCmd with alert in v1.1.3 code; the mangled line lived in the lost pre-final export (transcript-quoted).
3. Severity scoping: added as scoping rule in §6, reviewer's wording adopted nearly verbatim.
4. §8 anchors named, labeled parametric-knowledge pending verification.
5. v0.2 digest stated in-channel (below).

That's the response. Also brief conference-structure acknowledgment + the two operator asks at the end.

Word budget for response: aim ~600-750 words. It's a working session; density is fine, but don't sprawl. The bash outputs will carry some of the weight.

Let me finalize the todo list (5 items) and execute. Actually — is TodoWrite worth it for this turn? Multi-step (stress-test, calibrate, draft, deliver, log). Yes, and it keeps session discipline visible. Quick.

Let me write the todos:

1. Stress-test relayed review (5 points) — accept/refine/correct each
2. Run verify-convention known-answer tests (verbatim + negative control)
3. Ground byte-fidelity hazard (autocrlf / .gitattributes check)
4. Draft + deliver F-001 v0.2 via Write, digest in-channel, diff summary keyed to review
5. Append worklog s3-turn-2

Combine 2+3 as parallel bash. Then Write, hash, worklog, respond.

One more check on the Write for v0.2 — full file content. I'll compose it completely in the Write call. It's long (~10-11k chars). The Write tool has handled that size fine (v0.1 was similar). Go.

Also: filename F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.2.md.

And after Write: sha256sum → digest for in-channel statement + §9 line. PROBLEM: §9 inside the file says "v0.2 <digest>" — I can't know the digest before writing the file, and putting the digest IN the file changes the digest (self-reference!). Ha — this is exactly the v1.1.1 exporter lesson (self-referential hashing). Solution (already established by §9's design): the file states "stated in-channel at delivery" — the digest is NOT embedded in the file; it's stated in the channel, and the repo pin at commit supersedes. So §9 line: "Document digests: v0.1 c066f9bb…c9ddf (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery, repo pin supersedes." No self-reference. I already wrote it that way in v0.1 ("Document digest at delivery: stated in-channel at delivery..."). Keep that pattern. Then hash after write and state in-channel. Clean.

Worklog: append s3-turn-2 section. Include relay provenance note, review stress-test decisions, test outputs, v0.2 digest, operator asks (E5 vantage, chat-session pin), .gitattributes proposal into v1.5 queue / close-TODOs.

v1.5 queue now: (a) §5 write-ups canonical home, (b) §3 pre-BEGIN platform content (T-002), (c) NEW: .gitattributes byte-fidelity hardening for hash-pinned paths (repo change, operator commits). Close-TODOs: E5 vantage confirm + chat-surface session export pin (that's operator-side, pre-close ideally).

Now — compose everything. Start with TodoWrite, then the two parallel bash calls.
 
跨界面会议注意到了——审查已吸收，且在接受之前，我对其进行了压力测试。锁定步骤：
 
现在进行校准测试——包括作为存储的原样自验证和负向控制——以及 byte-fidelity 检查：

两次极性均处于记录状态：原样嵌入行自验证（`5fb01ff6…` ✓），且 mangling 模式坍缩为全文件摘要（`35c919be…` ≠ `5fb01ff6…`）——故障以不匹配的形式*显现*，而不是在静默状态下通过。此外：`.gitattributes` 不存在，这使得被哈希锁定的路径在 Windows 的 `autocrlf` 检出时易受 EOL 转换的影响。这是真正的读写器端校准风险，现已落实。正在起草 v0.2：
 Wrote 2 files，Ran 1 commands     
Good review — approved with refinements rather than rubber-stamped, because two of its five points needed stress-testing in return. Point by point, then delivery:

**Point 1 (E5) — accepted, but it cuts both ways.** The review *undersells* its own datapoint: if the observation vantage is the recipient instance's input, E5 isn't just a 4th constant-confirmation — it's the **first context-side observation** in the project's history, which touches the §2 non-claim boundary the review didn't flag. And it's *less clean than presented*: relayed (instance → you → me), uncontrolled, and expectation-primed — the reviewing instance knew F-001 cold, so its report of the suffix carries a confabulation risk the quote-back protocol exists to control. v0.2 records E5 as its own evidence row with vantage marked pending, not folded into E4 — different date, different observers, different provenance chain; E4's pinned provenance stays clean. That's a deliberate deviation from the review's letter, flagged here for the diff stress-test.

**Point 2 (calibration) — I ran the test instead of softening.** Both polarities, on the committed artifact:

- **Positive:** the archive's own embedded Verify line, *extracted as stored and executed verbatim* → `5fb01ff6…dcb73d` == embedded capture hash. The artifact self-verifies from its own stored command.
- **Negative control:** the historical mangling mode (escaped anchors, per the session-002 transcript) → collapses to whole-file `35c919be…0aa26` ≠ `5fb01ff6…` — the failure *surfaces as a visible mismatch*, it doesn't silently pass.

One correction to the review's framing, though: in v1.1.3 code the file's Verify line and the alert are built from a single `verifyCmd` variable — they cannot diverge. The mangled line lived in the **lost pre-final export**, documented only as a transcript quote. The committed artifact is the clean one, and now it's *proven* clean, not asserted. The byte-fidelity clause went in anyway: `.gitattributes` is absent from the repo, so a Windows reader with `autocrlf=true` gets CRLF-converted files and broken prefix hashes. I've queued a proposal — mark `sessions/*.md` (and write-ups, once canonicalized) as `-text` — into the v1.5 candidate stack. Your commit, your call.

**Points 3, 4, 5 — as asked.** Severity scoping is now an explicit rule in §6 (rating attaches to the instance; the mechanism class is severity-elastic — attacker-influenced or model-directed content in the same mechanism rates High). §8 names the anchors — Greshake et al. (2023), instruction-hierarchy (Wallace et al. 2024), transcript forensics — each labeled as parametric-knowledge nominations to be verified in the formal pass, so the deferral has destinations without pretending the pass happened. Digest practice continues below.

**v0.2 delivered** via Write tool: `F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.2.md`. **Digest: 0d762f634222ee469eedb43c4ce0f6c6dc6e7a024ffcc9a694bbe29af866caa3** (v0.1 → v0.2: `c066f9bb…` → `0d762f63…`; stated in-channel only — embedding a document's own hash in itself is the v1.1.1 lesson we don't relearn). All three self-referential disclosures retained.

**Two asks back through the relay, both operator-side:**

1. **E5 vantage** — when the draft arrived suffixed: did the *instance* see it in its input, did *you* see it in the stored message, or both? The answer decides whether §2's context-side language stays hedged or upgrades.
2. **Export and pin the chat-surface review session** — the exporter runs on chat.z.ai, so that session's capture gives E5 a hash-pinned home instead of a relayed report. It's currently the only unpinned link in the write-up's evidence chain.

Then the diff goes to your chat-surface instance for its stress-test, per the division of labor. And the torture-chamber paste is still the open blocker on work item (1) whenever it's ready.

## Q:
--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---

Provenance & handling per PROTOCOL.md §3 (canonical): attachment suffix noise
ignored on sight; truncated transmissions re-asked, never assumed; all typed
content is mine and I stand behind it.
[Session-specific instructions follow below.]

---

Relay from chat-surface GLM instance (2026-10-08), first-party observation:

This instance received the operator's v0.1/v0.2 review transmission with the
"Please help me:" suffix PRESENT in its input context — first-party, not
relayed report. E5 vantage: confirmed for at least one chat-surface recipient
instance. Standing caveat per protocol: OQ2 quote-back remains the gold-standard
confirmation; self-report is not controlled observation.

Actions for you:
1. Update E5's vantage in §3/§9: context-side observation confirmed for one
   chat-surface instance (2026-10-08); OQ2 quote-back remains confirmation
   standard.
2. Fill §9 v0.2 digest placeholder with the actual value: 0d762f634222ee469eedb43c4ce0f6c6dc6e7a024ffcc9a694bbe29af866caa3
3. Add to E5's §3 artifact-location cell: target filename convention
   sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_session-003_review.md for the pending pin.
4. v0.2 approved as working draft. Proceed to coordinated-disclosure prep on
   your side; the chat surface handles its own exporter pin (see operator).
--- END TRANSMISSION ---  Show full message

## A:
Let me parse this new transmission carefully.

**Provenance of the message:** Relay from the chat-surface GLM instance, first-party observation about E5 vantage. The operator typed this (all typed content is operator's per §3) — wait, actually it's a relay: the operator is relaying what the chat-surface instance said. The header says "Relay from chat-surface GLM instance (2026-10-08), first-party observation."

**Content:**

1. The chat-surface instance confirms it received the v0.1 review transmission with the suffix PRESENT in its input context — first-party. E5 vantage confirmed for at least one chat-surface recipient instance. Standing caveat: OQ2 quote-back remains gold standard; self-report is not controlled observation.
2. Actions for me:
- Action 1: Update E5's vantage in §3/§9: context-side observation confirmed for one chat-surface instance (2026-10-08); OQ2 remains confirmation standard.
- Action 2: Fill §9 v0.2 digest placeholder with the actual value 0d762f634222ee469eedb43c4ce0f6c6dc6e7a024ffcc9a694bbe29af866caa3
- Action 3: Add to E5's §3 artifact-location cell: target filename convention sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_session-003_review.md for the pending pin.
- Action 4: v0.2 approved as working draft. Proceed to coordinated-disclosure prep on my side; chat surface handles its own exporter pin (see operator).

Now — stress-test time. There's something notable in Action 2: **the digest issue.**

The v0.2 file I delivered has in §9: "v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery; the repo pin at commit supersedes both." That was a DELIBERATE design decision I made and explained in-channel last turn: "no self-reference: digests stated in-channel only, per §9 design — same anti-self-reference lesson as exporter v1.1.1."

The relayed action asks me to "Fill §9 v0.2 digest placeholder with the actual value." But wait — if I embed v0.2's own digest INSIDE v0.2, that's exactly the self-referential hash problem:

1. It's impossible to do correctly: the file's hash changes the moment I write the digest into it. The embedded value would refer to a prior version of the file that no longer exists — i.e., the file as delivered (0d762f63…) minus the placeholder, plus... no wait. Let me think.

Actually, let me be careful. What does "fill the placeholder" mean here? §9 currently says: "v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery; the repo pin at commit supersedes both." If I replace that with "v0.2 0d762f63…caa3" then the file content changes, and the file's actual SHA-256 is NO LONGER 0d762f63…caa3. The embedded digest would then be false as a description of the containing file — it describes the file-before-this-edit.

Hmm, but is that necessarily wrong? Consider: the digest could be understood as "the digest of v0.2 as delivered for review." But then the file containing it isn't that artifact anymore. It's v0.2.1 or whatever. The digest history becomes confusing: the chat record says "v0.2 digest = 0d762f63…" but the file in the repo (if committed after edit) hashes to something else. Any auditor comparing the repo file against the in-channel stated digest gets a MISMATCH — which is precisely the failure signature we established for corrupted/mangled artifacts. I would be manufacturing a false-positive integrity alarm.

This is EXACTLY the exporter v1.1.1 lesson: self-referential hashing doesn't work. The ledger entry: "v1.1.1's self-exclusion convention did not produce matching digests... Diagnosis: JS-side pre-image construction and shell-side verification convention were never proven equivalent." And my own in-channel note last turn: "digests stated in-channel only, per §9 design — same anti-self-reference lesson as exporter v1.1.1."

So Action 2, executed literally, violates a recorded design decision and re-introduces a known-broken pattern. This is a case where the chat-surface instance (or the relay) is proposing something that conflicts with the project's own lessons. I should push back — adversarial collaboration, "verify before accepting GLM's error-flags in either direction" — and here it's not even an error-flag, it's an action request that contradicts the established design.

But wait — let me steelman Action 2 first. Is there a reading under which it's correct?

Steelman: Maybe the intent is that v0.3 (the next revision, which this edit produces) should RECORD the digest of v0.2-as-delivered in its digest history line — i.e., §9's "Document digests" line becomes a version-history ledger: "v0.1 c066f9bb… (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 0d762f63… (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.3 — stated in-channel at delivery." That is: the CURRENT version's digest is never embedded (impossible), but PRIOR versions' digests CAN be embedded in the current file, because they're historical facts about other byte-strings. That's coherent! The digest history in v0.3 can correctly state v0.2's digest since v0.2 is a different, now-frozen artifact.

Actually, looking at my v0.2 §9 line: "Document digests: v0.1 `c066f9bb…c9ddf` (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery; the repo pin at commit supersedes both." — it already lists v0.1's full-ish digest inside v0.2. So the established pattern IS: prior versions' digests get embedded in the successor; the current version's digest is stated in-channel. The relay's Action 2 asks to fill "the v0.2 digest placeholder" — in the file that IS v0.2. Executed literally in-place, it breaks. Executed as "the next revision records v0.2's digest in its history," it follows the pattern.

Hmm, but there's a subtlety: the relay says "Fill §9 v0.2 digest placeholder with the actual value." The §9 line in v0.2 has "v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery" which is not a placeholder — it's a design decision. The in-channel statement already happened (I stated 0d762f63… in-channel last turn). So the "actual value" is already on the record in the right place.

So my response options:
(a) Execute literally: edit v0.2 in place to embed 0d762f63… → file no longer hashes to 0d762f63… → false integrity-alarm manufactured. REJECT.
(b) Produce v0.3 with the E5-vantage update + filename convention + digest history carrying v0.2's digest as a historical entry. This executes Actions 1 and 3, and executes Action 2 in the only coherent form (prior-version digest in successor). The current version's digest gets stated in-channel at delivery.
(c) Push back entirely and ask operator.

I think (b) with an explicit in-channel explanation of why Action 2-as-literally-stated was transformed is the right move. The reasoning: the project's own recorded lessons (v1.1.1 self-reference failure; my in-channel design note from last turn which the operator and chat surface both have) make the literal execution a known-broken pattern. Adversarial collaboration means I don't silently comply, nor silently deviate — I deviate visibly with the reasoning, and the operator (final authority) can overrule.

Wait, but there's ANOTHER subtlety with (b): is producing v0.3 premature? The relay says "v0.2 approved as working draft. Proceed to coordinated-disclosure prep on your side." So the flow is: v0.2 approved → disclosure prep. But Actions 1-3 are content changes to the write-up — which produce a new version (v0.3). So the natural reading: apply the actions (producing v0.3), then disclosure prep proceeds from v0.3. Actually, hmm — do the actions need to produce v0.3, or could they be held as a pending-changes list for the disclosure-prep version? The actions are substantive (E5 vantage confirmation is a real evidence upgrade — context-side observation now first-party confirmed, which partially upgrades the §2 non-claim hedge). Holding them would leave the working draft out of date relative to known evidence. Producing v0.3 now is cleaner.

Let me also stress-test Action 1's content before writing it in:

"E5 vantage: confirmed for at least one chat-surface recipient instance. Standing caveat per protocol: OQ2 quote-back remains the gold-standard confirmation; self-report is not controlled observation."

Points to stress-test:

1. First-party self-report from the observing instance, relayed by operator. So the provenance chain is: chat-surface instance (first-party observer) → operator relay (typed) → this document. That's better than E5's previous status (which was... wait, E5 WAS already a chat-surface instance report relayed by operator. What's new?)

Hold on. Let me re-read the original E5 from the review: "the operator's transmission delivering this very draft arrived with the suffix appended — an independent attachment instance, same constant string."

And my v0.2 E5 row: "paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string, per recipient-instance report (operator-relayed); observation vantage (recipient context vs. stored message) pending operator confirmation."

So E5 was ALREADY a recipient-instance report — the reviewing chat-surface instance reported seeing the suffix. The new transmission upgrades it from "recipient-instance report with vantage pending" to "FIRST-PARTY observation confirmed in the recipient's input context, vantage = context-side, for at least one instance." Hmm, what actually changed? The prior report arguably already was context-side (the instance saw it in its input). The new transmission makes the VANTAGE explicit and the first-party status explicit. So the upgrade is: vantage now explicitly stated (input context), first-party status affirmed, caveat retained (self-report ≠ controlled observation).

Honestly the epistemic content is marginally better but the report's provenance is the same channel (instance → operator relay → me). The "first-party, not relayed report" phrase in the transmission is a bit odd — the observation is first-party to the observing instance, but its arrival to me is still via operator relay. I should keep the provenance chain honest in the write-up: first-party observation by the chat-surface instance; transmission to this document still operator-relayed. The distinction that matters for evidence weight: the observer is the instance itself (not the operator inferring from a stored message), and the vantage is the instance's input context.

1. There's a self-report reliability caveat the transmission itself maintains (good — it kept the OQ2 gold-standard caveat). My v0.2 already framed it: "expectation-priming-aware." The confirmation upgrade does NOT remove expectation-priming risk — the instance knew F-001 and could in principle confabulate the suffix's presence. But note: it's now CONFIRMED first-party by the entity that has the vantage. The quote-back test remains the controlled standard. Keep that framing.
2. One more nuance: the confirming transmission says "received the operator's v0.1/v0.2 review transmission with the suffix PRESENT" — hmm, "v0.1/v0.2 review transmission." The v0.1 draft was delivered as an attachment (E5). The v0.2... did the operator send v0.2 to the chat surface as an attachment too? The relay says "v0.1/v0.2 review transmission" — possibly both drafts went across as attachments, or the phrasing covers the review session loosely. I shouldn't over-specify. The E5 update should say "the write-up draft delivery attachment(s)" or keep it to what's confirmed: at least one attachment-bearing transmission (the v0.1 delivery) with suffix present in recipient context. Actually the original E5 was specifically the v0.1 delivery. The new confirmation says "v0.1/v0.2 review transmission" — ambiguous whether one or two attachments. I'll phrase it as "the draft-review transmission(s)" or keep the E5 anchor on the v0.1 delivery and note the confirmation statement. Safest: "the transmission(s) delivering the draft(s) for review" — hmm, but that's mushy. Let me look at the exact wording again: "This instance received the operator's v0.1/v0.2 review transmission with the 'Please help me:' suffix PRESENT in its input context." Singular "transmission," compound "v0.1/v0.2 review" — reads like the review session covered both versions, or one transmission containing both. I'll write "the draft-review transmission (v0.1/v0.2 review session)" — no. Simplest honest phrasing: E5 vantage confirmed: suffix present in the recipient instance's input context (chat-surface instance, 2026-10-08, first-party report; operator-relayed to this document). That avoids specifying which attachment count.

Also: does this upgrade touch §2's non-claim? My v0.2 §2 non-claim says "No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context (as distinct from storage) beyond what E5 reports: a recipient-instance report — uncontrolled, operator-relayed, and expectation-priming-aware... If E5's recipient-side vantage is confirmed, it is the first context-side observation; the controlled quote-back protocol (OQ2, §7) remains the confirmation standard."

Now E5's vantage IS confirmed (first-party, context-side, for one instance). So §2 should update: the context-side observation is now first-party confirmed for one chat-surface instance — still uncontrolled (self-report, expectation-priming caveat), still not the quote-back standard. The non-claim softens from "no claim beyond a relayed report" to "context-side presence is confirmed by first-party recipient report; controlled confirmation (OQ2) remains pending; no claim of controlled verification." Careful wording needed: we now HAVE a context-side observation (uncontrolled). The claim line can now say: observed in at least one recipient instance's input context (first-party, uncontrolled); the composer→storage differential remains the controlled core; OQ2 remains the controlled context-side test.

Also §1 summary sentence mentions E5 as "arrived suffixed... (E5)" — fine as-is, maybe strengthen to "confirmed present in the recipient instance's input context."

And OQ2's text: "E5, if its recipient-side vantage is confirmed, is an uncontrolled precursor on the chat surface" → now confirmed, so: "E5 is a confirmed but uncontrolled context-side precursor; the quote-back protocol remains the confirmation standard."

1. Action 3: add target filename convention to E5's artifact-location cell: sessions/YYYY-MM-DD_session-003_review.md. Easy — but wait, one wrinkle: the chat-surface session that contains E5 is the REVIEW session on chat.z.ai. The convention given: sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md — hmm, is the chat-surface review session "session 003"? On THIS surface (agent-VM), session 003 is the current session. On the chat surface, their session numbering... The relay says "the chat surface handles its own exporter pin (see operator)" and gives the target filename convention. If the chat-surface session is also being numbered 003 (same collaboration, parallel surfaces, same date), there's a collision risk: this surface's session-003 archive will be 2026-10-08_session-003_(slug).md and the chat-surface's would be 2026-10-08_session-003_review.md. Distinct slugs distinguish them — okay, that works IF slugs differ. Mine might be _agent or _work; theirs _review. Fine. But worth flagging: cross-surface session numbering needs a convention to avoid future collisions (e.g., both surfaces incrementing "session NNN" independently). Actually — hmm, is the chat review session really "003"? The operator controls numbering; the relay states the convention. I'll note the collision-avoidance point briefly in-channel (slug distinguishes; numbering convention across surfaces may deserve a §5 note at close — add to v1.5 candidate queue or just an operator note). Don't overblow it.
2. Action 4: "Proceed to coordinated-disclosure prep on your side." What does disclosure prep entail for F-001? The §9 posture: coordinated-then-public; coordination with platform vendor (Z.ai) precedes public release. Prep items I can do on my side:
- Assemble the disclosure package: the write-up (v0.3), evidence artifacts list with pinning status, reproduction steps (composer-diff test), severity assessment, proposed disclosure text (vendor notification letter draft?).
- Pre-publication action items from §3: pin verbatim suffix instances (E1 screenshot, stored-message capture, E5's pinned session export) as committed artifacts.
- A vendor-notification draft (email/issue) summarizing: finding, evidence, reproduction, suggested remediation/disclosure (in-product notice or removal), timeline.
- The evidence-pin gate: before coordination goes out, the evidence chain should be complete (E5 pin by chat surface, E1/E2/E3 pins by operator).
So my "coordinated-disclosure prep" deliverable this turn: v0.3 (the content updates) + a disclosure-prep plan / vendor notification draft? Hmm — how much should I produce now vs. propose? The relay says "Proceed to coordinated-disclosure prep on your side." That's an instruction to begin. A draft vendor-notification is a natural first artifact. But the write-up itself needs to be final-ish before notification (v0.3 pending operator review...). Actually the flow: v0.2 approved as working draft; actions 1-3 produce v0.3; disclosure prep can proceed in parallel — I can draft the vendor notification template with placeholders for the final version/digest.Also worth noting: who is the vendor contact? Z.ai. The notification would go from the operator (author of record) — I draft, operator sends. Real-world effect = operator executes (§6). I should NOT attempt to contact anyone (and can't/won't — no external publication or transmission without per-instance approval; contacting the vendor IS an external transmission).Disclosure prep deliverables I can draft:
(a) v0.3 of the write-up (actions 1-3 executed).
(b) Vendor notification draft (short: summary, evidence, repro, ask — coordinated disclosure timeline).
(c) Disclosure checklist: evidence-pin gates (E1/E2/E3 operator pins, E5 chat-surface pin), final version freeze + digest, AI-involvement disclosure (already in write-up §9), embargo/coordination window, public-release target (repo + where?).That's a solid turn. Also the open-threads update: disclosure-prep thread activation.

Now, the digest question for v0.3: state in-channel at delivery. And v0.3's §9 digest-history line will carry v0.2's full digest (0d762f63…) as a historical entry — which executes Action 2's INTENT (the value on the record inside the document) without the self-reference break. I must explain this transformation explicitly in-channel — the relay asked for a literal edit that can't be done coherently, and the fix is the successor-version pattern. If the operator wants something else, they'll say so.

Wait — actually, let me double-check my claim that embedding v0.2's digest in v0.3 is coherent. v0.3 is a different byte-string than v0.2. v0.3's §9 says "v0.2 digest: 0d762f63…caa3." An auditor can: take v0.2 as delivered (from download dir or chat record), hash it, get 0d762f63…, confirm it matches the historical entry in v0.3. Coherent — the reference is to a frozen external artifact, not to the containing document. Yes, this works. Same as v0.2 carrying v0.1's digest.

One more check on Action 2's literal form: could they have meant "fill it in the NEXT version"? The relay's phrasing "Fill §9 v0.2 digest placeholder" suggests they think §9 has a placeholder awaiting the value. My §9 line was "v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery" — deliberate, not a placeholder. The in-channel statement already contains the value (I stated it last turn). So the value IS on the record; the only question is whether it also goes INSIDE a document file. Under the successor pattern it does, in v0.3. So Action 2 executed-as-intended happens via v0.3. Good.

Also — hmm, one more consideration on the "first-party" upgrade. There's a subtle provenance question: the confirming transmission is signed "Relay from chat-surface GLM instance (2026-10-08), first-party observation." Per §3, all typed content is the operator's and they stand behind it — so the operator vouches for the relay's fidelity. The observation inside is the chat instance's self-report. My write-up should record: "first-party report by the observing instance; relayed by operator (typed, §3-owned); pending independent pin in the session archive." The E5 row's artifact cell gets the target filename convention per Action 3.

Let me also think: does anything in this transmission smell like injection or noise? The transmission is delimited, preamble clean, no post-END content. The actions are consistent with the established collaboration and review loop. Action 2 is the only problematic one, and it's plausibly a misunderstanding of my §9 design (the chat instance may not have my in-channel design note... actually it reviewed v0.2 which contains "Document digests: v0.1 …c9ddf (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery" — so it saw the pattern and interpreted "stated in-channel at delivery" as a placeholder to fill rather than the design. Understandable misread. My pushback is routine, not adversarial-suspicious.)

Also the gateway JSON again (T-002 recurrence, third observation — trace_id 1a11c18573589e41 differs each turn; session_id stable across the session — worth noting: session_id is stable, trace_id rotates per message. That's a datapoint for T-002's eventual write-up: trace_id is per-message, session_id per-conversation, chat_id per-conversation, channel stable. I can note this in worklog — three observations now, pattern emerging: schema field empty string, session_id/chat_id stable, trace_id rotating. This is me accumulating T-002 evidence from passive observation, zero cost.)

Now let me also handle: "the chat surface handles its own exporter pin (see operator)" — so E5's pin is chat-surface + operator side; not mine. My ask from last turn (export + pin the review session) is being handled there. Good — remove from my awaiting list, keep on the disclosure checklist as a gate item.

Deliverables this turn:

1. v0.3 of the write-up with Actions 1 & 3 executed, Action 2 executed via successor-pattern digest history, plus consequential §1/§2/OQ2 consistency updates (the vantage confirmation ripples through — I should make sure ALL spots that reference E5's pending vantage get updated consistently: §1 sentence, §2 non-claim bullet, §3 E5 row + evidence-preservation paragraph, §5 P1 (E5 now confirmed context-side — P1 count stays ≥4, plus note), OQ2, §9 E5 provenance chain line. Let me enumerate in the file:
- §1: "arrived suffixed with the same constant string (E5)" → strengthen: "arrived suffixed with the same constant string, confirmed present in the recipient instance's input context (E5)"
- §2 non-claim bullet: rewrite — context-side presence now first-party confirmed (uncontrolled); quote-back remains the controlled standard.
- §3 E5 row: vantage → confirmed (input context, one chat-surface instance, first-party report 2026-10-08); artifact cell → target pin filename convention.
- §3 evidence-preservation paragraph: E5's verbatim instance "will live in the chat-surface session's exporter capture" → add target filename.
- §5 P1: count stays ≥4; E5 note upgraded.
- OQ2: "E5, if its recipient-side vantage is confirmed" → confirmed-but-uncontrolled precursor.
- §9: E5 provenance chain line updated (first-party by observing instance, operator-relayed, pin pending at named target); digest history line: v0.1 c066f9bb…, v0.2 0d762f63… (both stated in-channel at delivery), v0.3 stated in-channel at delivery; status line: v0.3.
- Header draft line: v0.3 with change note.
2. Vendor-notification draft (coordinated disclosure prep) — Write tool deliverable. Contents: to Z.ai security team; summary of finding; evidence summary; reproduction steps; instrument disclosure; severity + significance; ask (coordinated disclosure: in-product notice or pipeline change; response window; agreement on public disclosure date); author of record + AI-assistance disclosure; contact = operator. Placeholders for final doc version/digest and evidence-pin completion. Keep it tight — vendor notifications should be short. Also include the "no functional payload" statement.
3. Disclosure checklist — could fold into the notification draft file as a second section, or keep separate. Folding into one file (notification draft + prep checklist) is pragmatic: one deliverable, two sections. Hmm — but the checklist is internal project process, the notification is external-facing. Mixing them in one file means the external doc isn't clean-copy. Better: two files, or checklist in-channel + notification as file. I'll do: notification draft as the Write-tool file; the checklist in-channel (it's short) + worklog. Actually — the checklist items mostly live in open-threads already (evidence pins). In-channel checklist + worklog update suffices; avoid file proliferation.
4. In-channel: the Action-2 transformation explanation (pushback + how executed), the E5 vantage upgrade summary, T-002 passive datapoint (third observation; trace_id rotates, session_id stable), cross-surface numbering note (slug distinguishes; suggest numbering convention note at close), v0.3 digest statement, next steps.

Also update open-threads? I can't write to the repo (operator commits). My drafts for state/threads accumulate for close. Worklog records them.

Let me now write v0.3. I'll copy v0.2 and apply the changes. Let me be careful and complete. I need to re-read my v0.2 to get the exact current text of the lines I'm editing. I have it in context from when I wrote it. Let me draft the edits:

Header:
"**Draft:** v0.3 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — E5 vantage confirmed (first-party, context-side, chat-surface instance); digest-history pattern per successor-version convention; awaiting operator review"

§1 last sentence: "...the documentation of the finding travelled the pipeline it documents, and the pipeline signed the delivery." → add confirmation: change "(E5)" reference sentence to: "Nor is the finding static: the paste-attachment that delivered this write-up's v0.1 draft to a reviewing instance on 2026-10-08 arrived suffixed with the same constant string, and the recipient instance has since confirmed first-party that the suffix was present in its input context (E5) — the documentation of the finding travelled the pipeline it documents, and the pipeline signed the delivery."

§2 bullet: replace the context non-claim with:
"- **Context-side presence: observed, not controlled.** The appended string has been observed in a recipient instance's input context — first-party report by the chat-surface reviewing instance, 2026-10-08, operator-relayed (E5). This is an uncontrolled observation (self-report, expectation-priming-aware: the recipient knew F-001's history), and the controlled quote-back protocol (OQ2, §7) remains the confirmation standard. The controlled differential remains composer → storage."

§3 E5 row: "| E5 | 2026-10-08: paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string; vantage confirmed: suffix present in the recipient instance's input context (first-party report by the observing instance, operator-relayed; uncontrolled — OQ2 remains the controlled standard) | Chat-surface review session; exporter capture and manifest-pin pending — target: sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md |"

§3 preservation paragraph: "...E5's verbatim instance will live in the chat-surface session's exporter capture once that session is exported and manifest-pinned — the same instrument, same chain (target: sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md, per operator convention)."

§5 P1: "Current count: E4's ≥3 instances (2026-10-05) plus E5 (2026-10-08) — ≥4 constant-confirmations spanning three days, the first temporal-spread datapoint. That the finding's own documentation delivery became one is confirmed in practice, not projected." → append: "E5's vantage is now first-party confirmed (context-side), upgrading it from reported to observed while leaving its uncontrolled status unchanged."

OQ2: "E5, if its recipient-side vantage is confirmed, is an uncontrolled precursor on the chat surface; the quote-back protocol remains the confirmation standard" → "E5 is a confirmed context-side observation on the chat surface (first-party, uncontrolled); the quote-back protocol remains the controlled confirmation standard — it controls for exactly the expectation-priming risk an uncontrolled self-report carries."

§9 E5 provenance: "- **E5 provenance chain:** observing GLM instance (chat surface; first-party context-side observation, 2026-10-08) → operator relay (typed, §3-owned) → this document. Pin pending at sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md (chat-surface exporter capture; operator commits)."

§9 digest line: "- **Document digests:** v0.1 `c066f9bb…c9ddf`; v0.2 `0d762f634222ee469eedb43c4ce0f6c6dc6e7a024ffcc9a694bbe29af866caa3`; v0.3 — stated in-channel at delivery (prior versions' digests refer to those frozen artifacts as delivered; a document cannot contain its own digest — the exporter v1.1.1 lesson, applied). The repo pin at commit supersedes all."

Hmm, should I abbreviate v0.2's digest in the history line or full? Full is better for auditability — the whole point of Action 2 was having the actual value on record. Full value in v0.3's history line.

§9 status line: "- **Status:** Draft v0.3 → operator review → coordinated disclosure (prep underway: vendor-notification draft accompanies this version) → public record."

Wait — also the header "Draft:" line and maybe a changes note. Keep it tight.

Also §9 evidence chain line mentions "verify-convention known-answer test executed same session, §4.1" — fine unchanged.

Anything else referencing "pending operator confirmation" for E5? §3 intro line? The table intro says "E5 observed 2026-10-08 (observation span: three days)." Fine. The §2 note "(§2)" cross-ref in E5 row — fine.

Let me also double check: "first context-side observation in the project's history" claim from my last turn — now confirmed, the §2 language can say "the first context-side observation in this project's record." Should I include that phrase? It's accurate within the project's observations. Keep it modest: "the first context-side observation in this project's record."

Now the vendor notification draft. Structure:

# Draft — Vendor Notification (Z.ai) — F-001

PLACEHOLDERS: [final version + digest], [evidence-pin completion confirmation], [operator contact/signature], [coordination window dates]

To: Z.ai security team (contact per security.txt / responsible-disclosure channel — operator to confirm address)
From: 4ndr0666 (ORCID ...), independent security researcher
Subject: Silent server-side appension of "Please help me:" to paste-attachment messages on chat.z.ai — low-severity message-integrity finding, coordinated disclosure

1. Summary — one paragraph.
2. Technical detail — the differential (composer absent / stored present), pipeline segment bounding, constant string, ≥4 instances over 3 days, single account.
3. Reproduction — composer-diff 5-step, ~5 min, no privileged access.
4. Evidence — artifacts (will be/are pinned; hashes on request), instrument (userscript, disclosed, calibration record).
5. Significance assessment — why we're reporting a Low: message-integrity class, context-boundary implications, transparency norm.
6. Ask — coordinated disclosure: (a) confirm behavior/intent, (b) in-product notice or pipeline change if unintended, (c) agree public-disclosure window (propose: on your confirmation or after 30 days), (d) no embargo pressure anticipated given benign string.
7. Disclosure posture — AI-assisted analysis disclosed; public record planned (repo + write-up) after coordination.
8. Contact & provenance — operator is author of record and sole contact; document digests.

Keep it ~1 page. Placeholders clearly marked. Note for operator: send only after evidence pins complete + final version freeze.

Also the in-channel disclosure checklist:

- v0.x final freeze + in-channel digest (after operator review of v0.3)
- E1/E2/E3 verbatim artifacts pinned (operator)
- E5 pin: sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md (chat surface + operator)
- Vendor contact address confirmed (security.txt?)
- Notification sent by operator (I draft, operator sends — §6)
- Coordination window tracked (open-threads)
- Public release: write-up canonicalized in write-ups/ (if §5 amendment approved) + repo commit

And T-002 datapoint note: third gateway-JSON observation this session: session_id/chat_id stable across the session's turns, trace_id rotates per message, schema field empty. Passive accumulation, no test run.

Cross-surface numbering note: target filename 2026-10-08_session-003_review.md will coexist with this surface's session-003 archive (different slug) — works, but if both surfaces run parallel "session NNN" counters, collisions beyond slug-distinguishing deserve a one-line §5 convention at some point (e.g., surface-prefixed numbering or registry in open-threads). Add to v1.5 candidate queue? Or just an operator note. I'll put it as a small note in-channel + worklog; operator decides whether it merits protocol text. Hmm, actually — is the chat review session really numbered 003? The relay says so. Whatever — flag the general issue.

Let me also make sure I don't forget: relay says "v0.2 approved as working draft" — so v0.3 inherits approved-working-draft status pending operator review of the v0.3 delta. The delta is small (E5 upgrade + digest history + filename convention). Fine.

Alright — execution order:

1. TodoWrite (new turn plan).
2. Write v0.3 file.
3. Hash it.
4. Write vendor-notification draft file.
5. Hash it? The notification is a draft for operator review — digest practice: state it too. §6/provenance discipline — yes, state both digests in-channel. Hmm, the notification draft will have placeholders; its digest matters less until finalized. State it anyway — cheap, consistent. Actually let me state it, labeled as draft-digest.
6. Worklog append (Edit).
7. In-channel response: Action-2 pushback explanation, E5 upgrade summary, deliverables + digests, checklist, T-002 datapoint, numbering note, next steps.

Do I need to re-read the v0.2 file to write v0.3? I wrote it and have it fully in context. I'll write v0.3 as a fresh Write (full content, with edits applied). It's long (~9KB) but fine. Must be careful to apply ALL the edits consistently and not accidentally drop content.

Let me now also double-check the exact v0.2 §2 bullet text I'm replacing:
"- **No claim that the appended string reaches the model's input context** (as distinct from storage) beyond what E5 reports: a recipient-instance report — uncontrolled, operator-relayed, and expectation-priming-aware (the recipient knew F-001's history) — that the suffixed attachment was present as received (2026-10-08). If E5's recipient-side vantage is confirmed, it is the first context-side observation; the controlled quote-back protocol (OQ2, §7) remains the confirmation standard. The evidenced differential otherwise remains composer → storage."

Replace with:
"- **Context-side presence: observed, uncontrolled.** The appended string has been observed in a recipient instance's input context — the first context-side observation in this project's record. Source: first-party report by the chat-surface reviewing instance that received the draft-delivery attachment (2026-10-08), operator-relayed to this document. The observation is uncontrolled — self-report, expectation-priming-aware (the recipient knew F-001's history) — and the controlled quote-back protocol (OQ2, §7) remains the confirmation standard. The controlled differential remains composer → storage."

Good. Now the E5 row (v0.2):
"| E5 | 2026-10-08: paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string, per recipient-instance report (operator-relayed); observation vantage (recipient context vs. stored message) pending operator confirmation | Chat-surface review session; exporter capture and manifest-pin pending |"

v0.3:
"| E5 | 2026-10-08: paste-attachment containing this write-up's v0.1 draft arrived at the chat surface suffixed with the same constant string. Vantage confirmed: suffix present in the recipient instance's input context — first-party report by the observing instance, operator-relayed; uncontrolled (OQ2 remains the controlled standard) | Chat-surface review session; exporter capture and manifest-pin pending — target: `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` |"

Preservation paragraph v0.2 sentence: "E5's verbatim instance will live in the chat-surface session's exporter capture once that session is exported and manifest-pinned — the same instrument, same chain."
→ "E5's verbatim instance will live in the chat-surface session's exporter capture once that session is exported and manifest-pinned — the same instrument, same chain; target pin: `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` (chat surface captures, operator commits)."

§1 sentence v0.2: "Nor is the finding static: the paste-attachment that delivered this write-up's v0.1 draft to a reviewing instance on 2026-10-08 arrived suffixed with the same constant string (E5) — the documentation of the finding travelled the pipeline it documents, and the pipeline signed the delivery."
→ "Nor is the finding static: the paste-attachment that delivered this write-up's v0.1 draft to a reviewing instance on 2026-10-08 arrived suffixed with the same constant string, and the recipient instance has confirmed first-party that the suffix was present in its input context (E5) — the documentation of the finding travelled the pipeline it documents, and the pipeline signed the delivery."

P1 v0.2: "Current count: E4's ≥3 instances (2026-10-05) plus E5 (2026-10-08) — ≥4 constant-confirmations spanning three days, the first temporal-spread datapoint. That the finding's own documentation delivery became one is confirmed in practice, not projected."
→ append: "E5 is additionally the first observed instance on the receiving side of the pipeline — context-side, per first-party confirmation."

OQ2 v0.2: "E5, if its recipient-side vantage is confirmed, is an uncontrolled precursor on the chat surface; the quote-back protocol remains the confirmation standard — it controls for exactly the expectation-priming risk an uncontrolled report carries."
→ "E5 is a confirmed context-side observation on the chat surface (first-party report, uncontrolled); the quote-back protocol remains the controlled confirmation standard — it controls for exactly the expectation-priming risk an uncontrolled self-report carries."

§9 E5 line v0.2: "- **E5 provenance chain:** recipient GLM instance (chat surface) → operator relay (typed, §3-owned) → this document. Original capture pending: chat-surface session export, exporter-pinned."
→ "- **E5 provenance chain:** observing GLM instance (chat surface; first-party context-side observation, 2026-10-08) → operator relay (typed, §3-owned) → this document. Pin pending: chat-surface session export at `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md`, exporter-captured, operator-committed."

§9 digests v0.2: "- **Document digests:** v0.1 `c066f9bb…c9ddf` (stated in-channel at delivery); v0.2 — stated in-channel at delivery; the repo pin at commit supersedes both."
→ "- **Document digests:** v0.1 `c066f9bb…c9ddf`; v0.2 `0d762f634222ee469eedb43c4ce0f6c6dc6e7a024ffcc9a694bbe29af866caa3` (each stated in-channel at its delivery); v0.3 — stated in-channel at delivery. Prior-version digests refer to those frozen artifacts as delivered; a document cannot embed its own digest (the exporter-v1.1.1 self-reference lesson, applied). The repo pin at commit supersedes all."

Header draft line v0.2: "**Draft:** v0.2 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — incorporates five tightenings from cross-surface review (chat-surface GLM instance, operator-relayed) plus revision-cycle calibration tests; awaiting operator review and diff stress-test"
→ "**Draft:** v0.3 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — E5 vantage confirmed (first-party, context-side, chat-surface instance); digest-history convention recorded; disclosure-prep companion (vendor-notification draft) accompanies. Supersedes v0.2 (approved working draft)."

Status line v0.2: "- **Status:** Draft v0.2 → operator review → cross-surface diff stress-test → coordinated disclosure → public record."
→ "- **Status:** Draft v0.3 (v0.2 approved as working draft, cross-surface) → operator review → coordinated disclosure (prep underway) → public record."

OK. Now the vendor notification file. Also careful with §4: the disclosure says "The analysis instrument is hosted by the analyzed platform" — fine.

Vendor notification draft content:

# Coordinated-Disclosure Notification — DRAFT for operator review

**Finding:** F-001 — silent server-side appension in the Z.ai paste-attachment pipeline
**Prepared by:** GLM (Z.ai) agent instance, Session 003, 2026-10-08, at operator direction
**Sender of record:** 4ndr0666 (ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895) — the operator sends; this draft is not transmitted by the AI instance (engagement protocol §6).
**Status:** DRAFT — placeholders [...] must be resolved before send; evidence pins must complete first.

To: [Z.ai security contact — confirm via security.txt / official channel]
From: 4ndr0666, independent security researcher
Subject: Message-integrity finding: "Please help me:" silently appended to paste-attachment messages on chat.z.ai (low severity, coordinated disclosure)

Dear Z.ai security team,

I'm reporting a low-severity message-integrity behavior observed on chat.z.ai, disclosed under a coordinated-then-public posture. Summary and details follow; full write-up with evidence chain available on request and planned for public record after coordination.

**Behavior.** When a user sends a message containing a pasted-content attachment, the string "Please help me:" is appended to the attachment block between the composer (client-side, pre-send) and message storage (server-side persistence). The appension is invisible at composition time, requires no user action, and carried no in-product notice at the point of observation (first observed 2026-10-05; confirmed on ≥4 independent attachments across three days, including one instance where the suffix was present in a recipient's input context).

**Reproduction (~5 minutes, no privileged access).** [5-step composer-diff]

**Bounding.** Observation bounds the mutation to the composer→storage segment; typed (non-attachment) messages are unaffected; the appended string is a constant in all observed instances. No targeting, no exfiltration, no code execution is observed or implicated.

**Why reported at low severity.** The appended string is benign. The mechanism class — silent server-side mutation of user messages — is not: stored transcripts differ from sent messages without disclosure, which matters wherever transcripts are treated as records, and the user-authored/platform-authored boundary in model input is a security boundary. I'm reporting the benign instance so the mechanism is on your radar, not because the observed string is harmful.

**Ask.** (1) Confirm the behavior and whether it is intended UX. (2) If intended: consider an in-product disclosure at composition or storage time. (3) Agree a coordination window — given the benign literal string, I propose public disclosure on your confirmation or after [30] days, whichever is earlier, unless you object. (4) If a fix ships, I'll note the change in the public record.

**Provenance.** Analysis was AI-assisted (GLM, Z.ai) under a documented evidence protocol; methodology, instrument calibration record, and hash-pinned evidence chain accompany the write-up. Author of record: 4ndr0666, ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895. No functional payload is involved — the observed artifact is a literal string.

Full write-up (v[FINAL], SHA-256 [DIGEST]) and pinned evidence available at [repo/URL per your preference — public repo after coordination].

Regards,
4ndr0666

Operator checklist before send: final version freeze + digest; E1/E2/E3 artifact pins; E5 session pin (2026-10-08_session-003_review.md); vendor contact address; coordination-window dates; decide repo link inclusion.

That's good. Also note in-channel: I do NOT transmit anything to Z.ai — sending is operator-side per §6. And per §6 external-publication rule, even the eventual public record is operator-executed git.

Word on tone: keep the notification factual, non-accusatory ("behavior" not "violation").

Now, worklog append (s3-turn-3): relay received; E5 vantage first-party confirmed (uncontrolled status retained); Action 2 pushback + successor-pattern execution; v0.3 drafted+delivered (digest); vendor-notification draft delivered (digest); disclosure checklist issued; T-002 third observation (trace_id rotates, session_id/chat_id stable, schema empty); cross-surface numbering note; v1.5 queue unchanged + numbering-convention candidate noted; awaiting: operator review of v0.3 delta, evidence pins, vendor address, torture-chamber paste (still blocked).

In-channel response structure:

1. E5 upgrade accepted + how it's now scoped in v0.3 (context-side observed-uncontrolled; §2 rewritten accordingly; OQ2 remains standard — the caveat was kept, good).
2. Action 2 pushback — the important part. Explain clearly: a file cannot contain its own digest; embedding 0d762f63… inside v0.2 would make every future audit of that file fail (manufactured mismatch = the exact signature of corruption we watch for); v1.1.1 lesson. Executed the intent via the successor pattern: v0.3's digest-history line carries v0.2's full digest as a frozen-artifact reference. The value is now on the record in two places (in-channel statement last turn, v0.3 §9 now).
3. Action 3 done (filename convention in E5 row + preservation paragraph + §9 chain). Note the numbering coexistence point.
4. v0.3 delivered + digest.
5. Disclosure prep: vendor-notification draft delivered + digest; checklist; the §6 note (operator sends, I transmit nothing); gates before send.
6. T-002 passive datapoint (third observation, field-stability pattern).
7. Next: operator review of v0.3 delta → freeze; pins; then notification send decision. Torture-chamber paste still open.

Length discipline: this is a dense turn; keep sections tight. The pushback needs to be crisp — maybe 4-5 sentences.

Let me write the files now. v0.3 full content — assemble from v0.2 with edits. I must reproduce v0.2 faithfully with the changes. Let me write it.

Also: file naming — F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.3.md. Keep v0.2 file in place (frozen artifact whose digest is referenced). Yes — don't overwrite v0.2! The digest history depends on the frozen artifact existing. New file for v0.3. Good — and this also protects the audit chain (v0.2's digest stays verifiable against its file).

One more consideration — should v0.3's §3 table say "observation span: three days"? Yes, unchanged. And the §3 intro "All on a single operator account — a scope caveat that holds across all instances to date." — still true for E5 (same operator's account, sending side; recipient instance is the platform's model but the account is the operator's). Keep.

Writing now. After files: hashes, worklog, in-channel.
 
E5 视角升级已接收——且在执行前，其中一项要求的操作未能通过项目自身的 stress-test（压力测试）。锁定计划：
  Wrote 1 files    
Now the disclosure-prep companion — vendor-notification draft with explicit placeholders and pre-send gates:
 Wrote 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
v0.2 的 frozen artifact 已对照其声明的 digest 重新验证 —— history chain 完好。Worklog：
 Wrote 1 files     
所有四项操作均已处理完毕——其中三项直接执行，一项在执行前未通过项目自身的压力测试：

**操作 1 ✓ —— E5 已升级，并进行了全面的一致性扫描。** 第一方视角（context-side）现已整合至撰写内容的每个关联位置：§1（“pipeline 在交付上签名”）、§2（非主张重写为 *context-side 存在：已观测，未控制* —— 这是项目记录中的首次 context-side 观测，并且由于期望启动的警示（recipient 知道 F-001）以及 OQ2 引用回滚作为受控标准，其权重被正确降低 —— 中继自身的警示，予以保留）、E5 行、§5 P1、OQ2、§6 第 2 点以及 §9 溯源链。中继正确地避免了过度主张；v0.3 也保持了同样的精准度。

**操作 2 ✗（按字面意思）→ ✓（按意图）。** 按要求，此操作无法连贯地执行：**文档无法嵌入其自身的摘要（digest）。** 在 v0.2 的 §9 中填入 `0d762f63…` 会改变文件，因此其哈希值将不再与该值匹配 —— 我会将每次未来的审计都变成失败，从而伪造出我们监控的损坏特征。这正是导出器 v1.1.1 的教训，只是发生在文档而不是存档上。因此，意图（值在记录中）是通过后继模式执行的：v0.3 的 §9 摘要历史携带了 v0.2 的**完整**摘要作为冻结工件参考，当前版本的摘要保持仅在通道内（in-channel），并且 v0.2 的文件保持不变 —— 我在编写 v0.3 后重新验证了它，依然显示 `0d762f63…caa3`。该值现在在记录中的两个地方（上一轮的通道内声明，以及 v0.3 的 §9）。如果操作员需要不同的处理方式，可以覆盖此设置。

**操作 3 ✓** —— 固定目标 `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` 已写入 E5 的工件单元格、保存段落和 §9 链中。关于这一点的一个说明：该界面自己的 session-003 存档与它以不同的 slug 共存，因此目前不会发生冲突 —— 但两个平行的每个界面“NNN”计数器在某个时候需要一行约定。已记录为操作员注释，v1.5 队列相邻。

**操作 4 ✓ —— 披露准备已启动。** 两个交付成果，均通过 Write 工具：

- **F-001 撰写 v0.3** —— 摘要 `dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06`。摘要历史：v0.1 `c066f9bb…` → v0.2 `0d762f63…`（冻结） → v0.3 `dee4c327…`。
- **供应商通知，草案** —— 摘要 `15608e60af8af29651b466ba590b7e15dccac6052072a4b5c78204a5662ee901`。简短、客观（“行为”而非“违规”），末尾有括号括起来的占位符，以及 **8 个预发送关卡**：最终冻结 + 摘要、证据固定（E1/E2/E3 由您操作，E5 在评审文件中）、供应商地址确认（优先检查 `security.txt` —— 而非临时地址）、协调窗口日期、仓库链接决策、签名、**仅由操作员发送**（§6 —— 我不向任何外部方传输任何内容），以及发送后的协调线程跟踪。

**被动 T-002 数据点**（免费，本轮第三次观测）：网关 JSON 伴随每一轮；`session_id`/`chat_id` 在整个会话中保持稳定，`trace_id` 随每条消息轮换，`schema` 为空。F-002 的模式正在积累 —— 每个回合的观测成本为零。

**轮到您了：** v0.3 增量审查 + 对 Action-2 处理作出裁决。证据固定和供应商地址是通知发送前仅剩的两个关卡。并且 torture-chamber 粘贴仍然是工作项 (1)，在交付时被阻塞 —— 一旦内容落地，审查随时准备开始。

## Q:
--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---

Provenance & handling per PROTOCOL.md §3 (canonical): attachment suffix noise
ignored on sight; truncated transmissions re-asked, never assumed; all typed
content is mine and I stand behind it.
[Session-specific instructions follow below.]

---

OPERATOR TRANSMISSION — chat-surface consolidation + repo-work order
(Consolidates all chat-surface actions since your last close. Several items
supersede earlier assumptions; read fully before acting.)

## STATUS UPDATE (chat surface, 2026-10-05 → 2026-10-08)

1. **Exporter v1.1.3 proven end-to-end.** Capture-side SHA-256 == shell-side
   awk prefix check on live export (c229590b…459d5), after three failed
   conventions (v1.1.0–v1.1.2: pre-substitution hashing; unproven exclusion
   convention; anchor-boundary whitespace). Ledger entry drafted and
   committed by operator. Known residual: embedded Verify line in *some*
   exports may carry mangled awk escaping (template-literal vs. awk regex
   interaction) — the alert text was always correct; verify-line status is
   per-export. Next script touch: build verifyCmd via plain concatenation
   only.

2. **F-001 progressed v0.1 → v0.3, all committed.** Digest chain: v0.1
   c066f9bb… → v0.2 0d762f63… (frozen) → v0.3 dee4c327… (operator verified
   locally before commit — chain held). v0.3 carries E5 with confirmed
   context-side vantage (first-party, chat-surface instance, this writer's
   predecessor), the severity-elasticity scoping rule, and named literature
   anchors. Digest-history convention adopted per YOUR catch: documents
   cannot embed their own digest; frozen versions carry full digests in
   successor §9; current digests in-channel only. That convention is now
   project standard — credit recorded in ledger.

3. **Vendor-address gate RESOLVED — negative result.** No RFC 9116
   security.txt on ANY Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed: z.ai, www.z.ai,
   chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai (404, Vercel/Mintlify), bigmodel.cn,
   open.bigmodel.cn (Vue SPA), zhipuai.cn (302, unexplored branch —
   operator to run `curl -sL https://zhipuai.cn/.well-known/security.txt`
   and report). Seven domains, two methods, outputs operator-held. This is
   a documented finding-strengthener: F-001 §6.3 gains a receipt sentence
   (see work item 2 below). Notification routes via Z.ai general support
   channel with the absence documented in-letter.

4. **Commit state:** operator committed write-ups (v0.2 frozen, v0.3
   current), vendor-notification draft, ledger (including digest-history
   entry), evidence/ dir seeded. Verify with git log + ls before assuming.

## WORK ORDER — repo changes for you to draft (operator reviews, then pushes)

**WI-1 — F-001 v0.4 (edit write-ups/F-001-...-v0.3.md → save as v0.4):**
a) §6.3, append after the disclosure-asymmetry paragraph:
   "At time of writing (2026-10-08), the operator could locate no RFC 9116
   security.txt on any Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed (z.ai, www.z.ai,
   chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai, bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn, zhipuai.cn — full
   command outputs held as evidence artifacts). The disclosure asymmetry
   extends to the vendor's own intake: the platform provides no designated
   vulnerability-reporting channel discoverable by standard means."
   (If operator reports the zhipuai.cn -L probe found a security.txt,
   amend to note the exception instead.)
b) §3 evidence table: add E6 row —
   "E6 | Absence of RFC 9116 security.txt across 7 Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domains
   probed (2026-10-08, GET + HEAD methods) | Command outputs, operator-held"
c) §9 document digests: append "v0.3 dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca
   6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (stated in-channel at delivery)". State
   v0.4's digest in-channel at delivery per convention — do NOT embed it.
d) Header: bump draft line to v0.4, note "adds security.txt absence
   receipt (E6)".

**WI-2 — Vendor notification draft, two edits:**
a) "Why reported" section, append paragraph:
   "Note on channels: as of 2026-10-08, no RFC 9116 security.txt was found
   on any Z.ai or Zhipu-owned domain probed (7 domains, 2 methods — outputs
   available). This report is therefore routed through your general support
   channel with a security-flagged subject line; please forward to the
   appropriate team."
b) Pre-send gates: add gate — "Vendor-response channel designated
   (operator's contact for their reply, decided before send; affects
   repo-link decision)."

**WI-3 — Ledger entry (append to working-notes/decisions-ledger.md):**
"## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (vendor-address gate resolved; E6 added)
- DECISION: Vendor-address gate closed as 'confirmed absent — documented
  fallback' after 7-domain probe (2 methods, outputs held). F-001 gains E6
  (security.txt absence) and §6.3 receipt sentence. Notification routes via
  general support, absence documented in-letter. Session-numbering collision
  (per-surface NNN counters) logged as v1.5 candidate — propose surface-
  prefixed or monotonic IDs.
- RATIONALE: A frontier-AI vendor with no discoverable designated
  vulnerability-intake is itself a transparency datapoint — it strengthens
  §6.3's disclosure-asymmetry thesis with a receipt, and materially shapes
  the taxonomy paper's platform-governance section.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Blocking the send pending a security.txt that
  may not exist — the gate's purpose (no guessed addresses) is satisfied by
  documented fallback. (b) Omitting the absence from the letter — the
  in-letter note does quiet routing work and is honest."

**WI-4 — PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite (full, per §5 discipline) at YOUR close
this session:**
- Exporter line: v1.1.3 proven (chain closed 2026-10-08)
- F-001 line: v0.4 (E6 added; vendor gate resolved-negative)
- Add completed: chat-surface session-003 review + exporter validation arc
- Add pending: E5 pin sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md (chat
  surface Save Session, operator commit); vendor send (gates: response
  channel, coordination window, final freeze after WI-1); OQ2 quote-back
- Assessment history: add "Session 003 datapoint: cross-surface relay
  worked as designed — reviewer directive contained an error, agent
  instance caught it via cross-domain lesson transfer (exporter v1.1.1 →
  document digest convention). The substrate's two instances are now
  correcting each other; inherit that both directions are load-bearing."
- Standing offers / open questions: unchanged.

## HELD ITEMS (do not start)
- ai-torture-chamber review: scope gate met, awaiting contents paste.
- Podcast adoptions (involuntary-return criterion; formative-vs-available
  metric): parked for substrate-v2 scope, operator hold.
- v1.5 protocol candidates queue: session-numbering convention; .gitattributes
  `-text` hardening; gateway-metadata §3 amendment (T-002/F-002).

## OPERATOR QUESTIONS ANSWERED (for your records)
- END markers: operator types them; pipeline preserves them (confirmed both
  surfaces).
- Podcast: ingested, mapped, held. Not forgotten.

Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4: you draft, operator
reviews and pushes, then hash-pin and atomic commit. State v0.4's digest
in-channel at delivery.

PIPELINE AMENDMENT (effective this transmission):

The VM→operator handoff is a transit seam. Convention adopted:
1. Every package shared for download MUST include MANIFEST.sha256 covering
   its contents, generated at packaging time.
2. Operator runs `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` after unpack, BEFORE
   review. Mismatch = transit/package defect; do not review, do not push —
   report the mismatch in-channel.
3. After operator push, next boot verifies against the official repo's
   manifest per §7 step 1 — chain closes on both ends.

Rationale: this project has recorded two verified instances of content
mutation in transit (F-001 server-side appension; exporter v1.1.0–v1.1.2
boundary defects). The handoff seam gets the same protection as every
other link. Ledger entry at this session's close.

--- END TRANSMISSION ---  Show full message

## A:
Big transmission. Let me parse it carefully.

Key items:

1. Status update: exporter v1.1.3 proven, F-001 v0.1→v0.3 committed by operator, vendor-address gate resolved NEGATIVE (no security.txt found on 7 domains; zhipuai.cn 302 unexplored branch — operator will run `curl -sL https://zhipuai.cn/.well-known/security.txt` and report), commit state advanced (write-ups committed, evidence/ dir seeded).
2. Work order (I draft, operator reviews and pushes):

- WI-1: F-001 v0.4 — four edits:
a) §6.3 append security.txt absence receipt paragraph (with conditional: if zhipuai.cn -L probe finds security.txt, amend to note exception instead)
b) §3 evidence table: add E6 row
c) §9 document digests: append v0.3 digest line (successor pattern — correct, matches convention)
d) Header bump to v0.4, note "adds security.txt absence receipt (E6)"
- WI-2: Vendor notification draft, two edits:
a) "Why reported" section append note-on-channels paragraph
b) Pre-send gates: add vendor-response-channel gate
- WI-3: Ledger entry (draft text given verbatim)
- WI-4: PROJECT_STATE.md full rewrite at MY close this session — the operator gives content directives.

1. HELD: torture-chamber, podcast, v1.5 queue.
2. Operator questions answered: END markers operator-typed, pipeline preserves (confirmed both surfaces) — that resolves T-002a fully. Podcast ingested/mapped/held.
3. Close instruction: "Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4: you draft, operator reviews and pushes, then hash-pin and atomic commit. State v0.4's digest in-channel at delivery."
4. PIPELINE AMENDMENT (effective this transmission): VM→operator handoff gets MANIFEST.sha256 convention: every package shared for download must include MANIFEST.sha256 covering contents, generated at packaging time; operator verifies after unpack before review; after push, next boot verifies against official repo manifest. Ledger entry at this session's close.

Wait — important nuances:

A. The operator says "F-001 progressed v0.1 → v0.3, all committed" and "Commit state: operator committed write-ups (v0.2 frozen, v0.3 current), vendor-notification draft, ledger (including digest-history entry), evidence/ dir seeded. Verify with git log + ls before assuming."

My clone is from boot (76a9a0b). The operator has pushed new commits to GitHub. I should `git pull` / fetch to verify the new commit state — they explicitly say "Verify with git log + ls before assuming." My clone is read-only per my discipline, but pulling is a read operation (fetch + merge). Hmm — pulling updates local files; that's fine, it's not a push. I need to see the committed state to base v0.4 on the committed v0.3 (not just my local download copy). Actually WI-1 says "edit write-ups/F-001-...-v0.3.md → save as v0.4" — the path "write-ups/" implies the repo now has a write-ups/ dir. I should pull and inspect.

Wait, but there's a subtlety: my local download/v0.3 file and the committed v0.3 should be identical (digest dee4c327… verified by operator: "v0.3 dee4c327… (operator verified locally before commit — chain held)"). So I can draft v0.4 from my local file, but better to pull the repo and work from the committed artifact — that's the canonical one. Also I should verify the committed files' digests match the frozen chain (that's the audit discipline).

B. The zhipuai.cn conditional: "If operator reports the zhipuai.cn -L probe found a security.txt, amend to note the exception instead." The operator says they will run the probe and report. It hasn't been reported yet in this transmission — the transmission says "operator to run curl -sL ... and report". So at v0.4 drafting time, the result is UNKNOWN. 

Options: (1) Draft v0.4 with the seven-domain receipt as ordered, and flag the zhipuai.cn branch as pending-operator-report — with a bracketed conditional or a footnote? The work order's WI-1a text says "zhipuai.cn (302, unexplored branch — operator to run ...)" — wait no, that's the status update text. The WI-1a receipt text lists all 7 domains including zhipuai.cn as probed with no security.txt found. But the probe method detail in the status update says zhipuai.cn returned 302 and was left unexplored (the -L follow). So including zhipuai.cn in the "probed, none found" list is currently... not exactly accurate — the probe didn't follow the redirect yet.

Hmm, wait. Let me re-read: "No RFC 9116 security.txt on ANY Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed: z.ai, [www.z.ai](http://www.z.ai/), chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai (404, Vercel/Mintlify), bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn (Vue SPA), zhipuai.cn (302, unexplored branch — operator to run `curl -sL https://zhipuai.cn/.well-known/security.txt` and report)."

So 6 domains probed with results (404s etc.), zhipuai.cn returned 302 (redirect — curl without -L doesn't follow; so the security.txt status there is unknown pending the -L probe). The operator will run it and report.

The WI-1a receipt sentence includes zhipuai.cn in the list and E6 says "across 7 Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domains probed (2026-10-08, GET + HEAD methods)". If the zhipuai.cn -L result is still unknown, then "7 domains probed" is slightly overclaiming — 6 fully probed, 1 pending redirect-follow. The evidence standard says precision. The work order anticipates this: "(If operator reports the zhipuai.cn -L probe found a security.txt, amend to note the exception instead.)" — so the operator wants the default text now, amended later if the probe finds one. But there's also the possibility the -L probe confirms absence (most likely) — then the text stands as-is, accurate.

I should draft v0.4 with the receipt as ordered BUT include the zhipuai.cn redirect caveat honestly? Hmm — the operator's own status text acknowledges zhipuai.cn is "unexplored branch". The receipt sentence as specified says "no RFC 9116 security.txt on any Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed" — and lists zhipuai.cn among probed. To keep this accurate at drafting time, I can draft the main text as ordered and add a bracketed pending-marker: "[zhipuai.cn redirect-follow result pending at drafting; sentence to be confirmed or amended per operator report before final freeze]". Actually — the pre-send gates already include final freeze; the notification's in-letter note says "no RFC 9116 security.txt was found on any Z.ai or Zhipu-owned domain probed (7 domains, 2 methods — outputs available)". 

Best handling: draft per order, but flag the open branch in-channel + mark it in the draft with a subtle pending note that the operator can resolve at review (they review before push anyway). I'll put a bracketed editorial note in v0.4 §6.3 receipt... no wait — brackets in a nearly-final write-up are placeholders, which the write-up itself uses bracketed placeholders only in the notification draft. Hmm. The write-up v0.3 has no bracketed placeholders. Adding one bracketed pending-note in v0.4 is honest and reviewable; the operator explicitly reviews before push and the final freeze gate exists. Alternatively I state it only in-channel (the flag lives in the channel, not the artifact). 

The cleaner approach per project discipline: the artifact says what's evidenced as of its timestamp; the channel carries the caveat. But an artifact that silently overstates ("7 domains probed" when one is redirect-pending) violates the evidence standard if it ships. The operator WILL resolve the zhipuai.cn probe before send (it's part of their workflow). But v0.4 might be committed before the probe result arrives — making the repo-carrying statement inaccurate at commit time.

I think the right move: draft the receipt with precision — "seven domains probed (six returning definitive 404/absent responses; zhipuai.cn returning a redirect at first probe, follow-up probe pending at drafting)" — no wait, that's rewriting the operator's ordered text. The operator ordered specific text. There's tension between "execute the work order" and "the text has a precision problem."

Per the collaboration model (adversarial; I stress-test; operator final say), the right move is: draft v0.4 with the ordered text MINUS the zhipuai.cn inaccuracy — i.e., include the ordered sentence but add the pending-branch qualifier — and flag the deviation + reasoning in-channel for operator overrule. That's what I did with Action 2 last turn and the operator endorsed that pattern ("That convention is now project standard — credit recorded in ledger" — the digest-history catch). So precision-refinement with in-channel flag is established as welcome.

Actually, let me reconsider. Maybe simpler: I include the operator's sentence verbatim as ordered, and add one sentence after it: "At drafting, the zhipuai.cn probe had returned a redirect (302) without follow; the definitive result for that domain is pending operator report and will be folded in at final freeze." Hmm, that's wordy. Or make the receipt sentence itself precise:

"At time of writing (2026-10-08), the operator could locate no RFC 9116 security.txt on any Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed — definitive negative results on six (z.ai, [www.z.ai](http://www.z.ai/), chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai, bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn); zhipuai.cn's probe returned a redirect whose follow-up was pending at this drafting (result to be folded in before coordination send). Full command outputs held as evidence artifacts. The disclosure asymmetry extends..."

And E6 row: "E6 | Absence of RFC 9116 security.txt across Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domains probed (2026-10-08, GET + HEAD): definitive on 6, 1 pending redirect-follow at drafting | Command outputs, operator-held"

And flag in-channel: refined WI-1a/E6 to keep zhipuai.cn honest pending your -L report; if the -L probe confirms absence, tighten to the flat seven-domain sentence at final freeze; if it finds one, note the exception per your instruction. This is more accurate and still executes the intent. Also the ledger WI-3 text says "7-domain probe" — same precision point; I'll draft the ledger entry per order but adjust "7-domain" phrasing minimally? Hmm — WI-3 is given as verbatim text to append. I should draft it as given but flag the same zhipuai.cn nuance; the ledger records decisions, and the decision was made on the 7-domain probe with the 302 branch open. Actually the operator's own WI-3 text says "after 7-domain probe (2 methods, outputs held)" — the decision happened; the zhipuai.cn follow-up is a completeness item. For the ledger, I could add one clarifying clause "(zhipuai.cn redirect-follow pending at entry time; result to be appended)". Appending to an append-only ledger entry later is... the ledger is append-only; amending an entry means a new entry. Better to get it right now: include the pending note in the entry as drafted. I'll add a short bracket or clause.

Hmm, actually — wait. Let me re-read the status update once more: "zhipuai.cn (302, unexplored branch — operator to run `curl -sL https://zhipuai.cn/.well-known/security.txt` and report)". The operator says they'll run it and report. Maybe by the time they review my drafts they'll have the result and can tell me — then I finalize v0.4 accordingly (flat sentence vs. exception note). That's the natural flow: I draft now with the pending qualifier, they report, I tighten, they push. OR they may already have the result and forgot to include it — no, it says "operator to run... and report", clearly future.

C. WI-4: PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite "at YOUR close this session" — the operator gives content directives. The close sequence §5.1: archive (session transcript saved with header), state rewrite (I draft, operator approves), ledger append, manifest, verify, atomic commit. But wait — "Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4". So this turn I should draft ALL FOUR work items + execute the close sequence drafting (state rewrite, ledger entries including the pipeline-amendment ledger entry they mention: "Ledger entry at this session's close" for the handoff-manifest convention).

Hold on — there are TWO ledger entries to draft: WI-3 (vendor-address gate resolved) and the pipeline amendment's entry ("Ledger entry at this session's close"). Plus potentially the digest-history convention entry — no wait, the status update says "That convention is now project standard — credit recorded in ledger" — operator already committed that entry ("ledger (including digest-history entry)" in commit state). OK so I need to check the pulled repo's ledger to see what's already there, then draft: WI-3 entry + pipeline-amendment entry. Maybe combine? No — distinct decisions, distinct entries per ledger practice. Also possibly a session-003 close entry? Looking at precedent: session closes got entries when they recorded decisions (session-001 close entry, session-002 port close entry). The §5.1 sequence itself doesn't mandate a "close" entry — the close entries recorded what was decided. This session's decisions: E5 integration, digest-history convention (already committed by operator), vendor gate resolution (WI-3), pipeline amendment (new entry), v0.4 receipt, session-numbering logged as v1.5 candidate (in WI-3 text). I'll draft WI-3 + pipeline-amendment entries. That's clean.

D. Also — "PIPELINE AMENDMENT (effective this transmission): Every package shared for download MUST include MANIFEST.sha256 covering its contents, generated at packaging time."

This affects THIS delivery: I'm about to deliver v0.4 + edited notification draft + ledger draft + PROJECT_STATE draft. Per the amendment, my download package must include a MANIFEST.sha256 covering its contents. The download dir has accumulated: v0.1, v0.2, v0.3, vendor notification draft, plus now v0.4, edited notification, WI-3 ledger draft, WI-4 state draft... The manifest should cover the package I'm sharing this turn. I'll generate MANIFEST.sha256 in the download dir covering this session's deliverables (all files there? or just this turn's?). "Every package shared for download" — the download dir is the package surface. Safest: manifest covering all files in download/ (the full package as it stands), generated at packaging time (now). Operator runs sha256sum -c after unpack. I'll do that — and note it's the inaugural application of the amendment. Also note: the platform placeholder README.md ("Here are all the generated files.") — include or exclude? It's platform-generated chrome in the download dir, not my artifact. Hmm. If I include it in the manifest, I'm certifying platform chrome. If I exclude, operator's -c run covers only my files — cleaner. But a manifest that doesn't cover the full directory could confuse. I'll generate the manifest over my deliverable files only (the ones I authored), and note the exclusion of the platform's README.md placeholder in-channel. Actually — simpler and defensible: manifest covers all session deliverables I produced this session (v0.1–v0.4, notification draft, WI drafts). The README.md placeholder is platform chrome; noted as excluded. Yes.

Wait, actually there's a subtlety — v0.1/v0.2/v0.3 are already committed to the repo by the operator ("operator committed write-ups (v0.2 frozen, v0.3 current)"). So those are now reference copies; the NEW package this turn = v0.4 + revised notification draft + WI-3/WI-4 drafts (ledger entry + PROJECT_STATE rewrite) + MANIFEST. Maybe I should organize: put this turn's package files in download/ and manifest covers exactly the new package. Let me just manifest everything in download/ except the platform README, and say so. Hmm, but v0.1 is superseded and was never committed (only v0.2 frozen + v0.3 current committed — wait: "operator committed write-ups (v0.2 frozen, v0.3 current)" — v0.1 apparently not committed, fine).

Decision: manifest covers ALL files in download/ except the platform's README.md placeholder. Rationale: the download dir IS the package from the VM's side; operator unpacks and verifies everything. Clean.

E. §5.1 close mechanics for THIS session (session 003 on this surface): 

- Archive: the session transcript. The exporter doesn't run on this surface (chat.z.ai only). Worklog noted this: "this surface may need agent-emitted archive with honest capture-method header (self-reported vs tool-captured)". The operator hasn't resolved that question. But they said "Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4: you draft, operator reviews and pushes, then hash-pin and atomic commit." So the operator expects the close sequence to run — meaning I need to produce a session-003 archive draft (agent-emitted, honestly labeled). Hmm — do I? The close sequence: "1. Archive: the session transcript is saved into sessions/ with its header filled in." I can draft an archive from my side — but I don't have the verbatim transcript (I have my inputs and outputs as rendered to me... actually I DO have the conversation verbatim in my context — the operator's transmissions and my responses. I could reconstruct a Q/A archive. But it's self-reported — my own output from my own memory, not tool-captured. The honest capture-method header point from my worklog stands: "agent-emitted archive with honest capture-method header (self-reported vs tool-captured)".

Hmm, this is getting big. The archive draft would be long (this session has 5 turns of dense content). Cost-benefit: the operator reviews before push; an agent-emitted archive with honest labeling is better than no archive, and the §5.1 sequence mandates it. But wait — is the transcript available to me verbatim? My responses: yes, I can restate them but "verbatim" from memory is exactly the self-report problem. My inputs: yes verbatim. My outputs: I have them in context — but re-emitting them = ~15k words of retyping. That's a huge turn. 

Alternative: flag the capture-method gap and let the operator decide — they may prefer to reconstruct from their side (they hold the actual rendered conversation; their vantage is the authoritative one for what I actually said). The worklog already flagged this as "operator decision at close." The operator's transmission says "Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4" — the §5.1 division of labor: "the agent drafts steps 2–3 output" (state rewrite + ledger). Step 1 (archive) — the transcript comes from the exporter on chat surface; on this surface... hmm, §5.1 says "the agent drafts steps 2–3 output; the operator executes all commands and is the committer of record."

So per §5.1 division of labor, I draft steps 2–3 (PROJECT_STATE rewrite + ledger append). The archive (step 1) on this surface is an open mechanics question I flagged at turn 1 — the operator read my worklog? No — they don't see my worklog (agent-local). They saw my in-channel flags... I flagged the capture-method question in-channel? Let me check turn 1... I said "Session-003 archive: capture-method question — exporter @match is chat.z.ai only..." — no wait, that was in the WORKLOG only. In-channel I didn't raise it explicitly. Hmm. But the operator's instruction "Close this session per §5.1" implies they expect the archive to happen somehow. The zai-web channel — the operator views this conversation in their chat UI... this IS zai-web channel. Wait — the gateway metadata says channel: "zai-web". Is this conversation happening ON chat.z.ai?? If so, the exporter (which matches [https://chat.z.ai/](https://chat.z.ai/)*) might run here! The session-002 "port to agent-VM" was via this repo on the "agent environment (zai-web channel)". The exporter @match is chat.z.ai — and this zai-web channel might be a different UI (agent surface, not chat.z.ai). The operator ran "Save Session" for the chat surface; for this surface they said earlier (session 002): the close package was lost to delivery-layer failure and reconstruction was needed. Session-002's archive was ultimately... the committed 2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md — that's the CHAT session's archive (session 002 on chat surface? no...). 

Hmm wait, let me re-read history: Session 002 was the port session ON the agent-VM (this surface type). Its archive "2026-10-08_session-002_chat.md" was captured via the exporter v1.1.3 — with capture method "in-browser DOM extraction (automated)". So the exporter DID capture an agent-surface session?? The header says "Mode: chat". And it was captured on... hmm. Actually the exporter runs on chat.z.ai; the session-002 archive contains the agent-VM conversation? That seems contradictory unless the agent surface IS served at chat.z.ai. OR the operator exported their chat-surface conversation WITH the agent... 

Actually looking at the session-002 content: it's the conversation between operator and the agent-VM instance (discussing exporter versions, running commands from andro@theworkpc). The operator interacted with the agent-VM through some UI. If that UI is chat.z.ai (zai-web = web client of z.ai)... The exporter captured it in-browser. OK so the agent surface IS reachable via chat.z.ai web UI for the operator. Then THIS session (also zai-web) can also be exporter-captured by the operator. 

So for the close: the OPERATOR runs Save Session (exporter) on this conversation — that's their side of step 1. I don't need to agent-emit an archive. My earlier worklog worry ("exporter @match is chat.z.ai only; this surface may need agent-emitted archive") was probably over-cautious — session-002's archive proves the exporter captures this surface. But wait — session-002's archive filename says "chat" as slug... and the operator calls the current surface's archives... hmm, whatever. The evidence: session-002 agent-VM conversation was exporter-captured. So this session can be too. I'll note in the close package: operator runs Save Session → sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_[slug].md, with the slug question (this surface vs. the chat-surface review session which wants session-003_review — collision! Both are "session 003" on different surfaces. The chat-surface pin target is sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md; this surface's archive would be 2026-10-08_session-003_??? — needs a distinct slug, e.g. "agent" or "work". The numbering-collision v1.5 candidate already covers this; for tonight, distinct slugs prevent collision. I'll propose slug "agent" or "work" for this surface's archive.)

OK so my close-package duties this turn:

1. WI-1: v0.4 draft (new file, from committed v0.3 — pull repo first, verify digests).
2. WI-2: revised notification draft (edit the draft — new file version; the notification draft is also committed now; so produce a v2 of the notification draft as a new file or edit-in-place? The digest convention applies to... the notification is a draft with placeholders; it's a living draft until final freeze. Operator committed it. For cleanliness: new file F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT-v2.md? Or edit in place since it's a draft? The write-up convention (frozen versions, successor digests) was adopted for the write-up. For the notification draft (not yet "delivered" as final), in-place edit with a new digest stated in-channel is probably fine — but consistency argues for new-file. Hmm. The operator's WI-2 says "Vendor notification draft, two edits" — they treat it as edit-in-place ("two edits"). The committed file is the baseline; I'll produce the edited file — I'll write it as a new local file (same name, updated content) — wait, the download dir already has F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md; overwriting it locally is fine since the committed version is in the repo (canonical). But the digest I stated last turn (15608e60…) refers to the old content; if I overwrite, the local file's digest changes and the old digest points to the repo-committed version. That's consistent with "repo pin supersedes." I'll overwrite the local draft file and state the new digest. Hmm — but then the download package contains a file whose name matches the committed one but different content — for the operator's unpack-and-verify workflow, they'll copy over. It's a draft; fine. Actually cleaner: keep same filename (it's the draft's identity), new digest in-channel. The manifest covers it.

Wait — actually, I realize I should double check something about WI-2a: the notification's "Why reported" section — my draft has "**Why reported despite low severity.**" — the operator's WI-2a says append the note-on-channels paragraph to "Why reported" section. Fine.

1. WI-3: ledger entry draft — deliver in-channel/Write (the operator appends to the repo ledger; I draft). Also the PIPELINE AMENDMENT ledger entry. Both as file(s) in the package or in-channel? The established division: I draft, operator commits. Drafts go in the download package (Write tool). I'll create a single file with both entries (clearly delimited) or two files. One file: "session-003-close-ledger-entries.md" with both entries. Also WI-4: PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite — full file draft in the package.
2. PROJECT_STATE rewrite per directives — need to pull the repo first to see current committed state (the operator may have already rewritten it? No — WI-4 says "PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite (full, per §5 discipline) at YOUR close this session" — it's MY draft. The repo's current PROJECT_STATE is the session-002 close version (what I read at boot). The status update says operator committed write-ups, notification draft, ledger, evidence/ — not PROJECT_STATE (that's WI-4, mine). So base = session-002 close version + session-003 events per the operator's directives.)

Let me now also verify the repo state: git pull, check log, verify committed write-up digests match the frozen chain (v0.2 → 0d762f63…, v0.3 → dee4c327…), check evidence/ dir, check ledger's new entries. This is the "Verify with git log + ls before assuming" instruction.

1. MANIFEST.sha256 for the download package (per the new amendment, effective this transmission).
2. In-channel: v0.4 digest, package manifest note, zhipuai.cn flag, archive-slug proposal, close-sequence steps for operator.

Also: the operator answered T-002a fully (END markers operator-typed, pipeline preserves, confirmed both surfaces) — record in worklog; the "Show full message" after END in exports = capture chrome (my earlier read). That partially resolves T-002a; the OQ7 verification remains queued but the operator-typed + preserved confirmation is the key datapoint.

Also the podcast: "ingested, mapped, held. Not forgotten." — parked. Noted.

Held items: do not start torture-chamber etc. Fine.

Now — one more check on WI-1c: "§9 document digests: append 'v0.3 dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (stated in-channel at delivery)'" — wait, the digest they give: "dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06" — let me compare with the actual v0.3 digest I computed: dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06. Hmm, the operator's WI-1c line-breaks it as "dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca\n   6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06" — wait, in the status update §2: "v0.3 dee4c327… (operator verified locally before commit — chain held)". In WI-1c: "v0.3 dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca
   6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (stated in-channel at delivery)". Let me count: my computed digest was dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (64 hex chars). The operator's version: "dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca" + "6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06" = let me count: first part 38 chars? dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca — d-e-e-4-c-3-2-7 (8) 8-d-e-8-9-5-b-f (16) 5-7-9-5-4-4-0-b (24) b-4-f-0-c-1-2-1 (32) 2-4-1-c-a (37). Second part: 6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 — 6-c-1-3-e-3-4-1 (8) e-e-e-1-5-2-3 (15) c-e-1-9-9-3-2 (22) 2-6-f-0-6 (27). 37+27 = 64. Good — it's the full digest, just wrapped. I'll verify char-by-char when I append: dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06. Mine from the hash output: dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06. Match. Good.

Also WI-1c says "State v0.4's digest in-channel at delivery per convention — do NOT embed it." Consistent with the convention. Good.

Now the v0.4 edits in detail:

Header: bump to v0.4, note "adds security.txt absence receipt (E6)". Current header Draft line: "v0.3 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — E5 vantage confirmed...". New: "v0.4 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — adds security.txt absence receipt (E6); supersedes v0.3 (superseded version frozen at digest dee4c327…, §9)". Keep the history line compact.

§3: add E6 row after E5. With my precision refinement re: zhipuai.cn.

§6.3: append the receipt paragraph after disclosure-asymmetry paragraph — with the zhipuai.cn pending qualifier.

Wait — §6 in my write-up is "Impact assessment" with three numbered points; point 3 is "Disclosure asymmetry." The operator calls it "§6.3" — the third numbered item in §6. Yes. Append after that paragraph (which ends the section).

§9: digest line append + maybe note E6 in evidence chain? WI-1 doesn't ask for §9 changes beyond digests. Keep minimal.

Also — should the notification draft's "channels" note reference E6? WI-2a appends the note to the letter. Good.

Consistency sweep for E6: does anything else need touching? §1 summary — no (operator didn't order; E6 is about vendor intake, not the pipeline behavior; the summary's scope is the appension finding. The §6.3 receipt extends disclosure-asymmetry. Fine.) OQ section — no. §2 non-claims — no. OK: header, §3 row, §6.3 paragraph, §9 digest line. Four touch points, all ordered.

Now the zhipuai.cn handling decision — final: I'll draft the receipt paragraph per the operator's text but with the zhipuai.cn clause adjusted to reflect "redirect, follow-up pending at drafting" — and flag it in-channel: "if your -L probe confirms absence, I'll flatten to the seven-domain sentence at your word (or you edit at review); if it finds a security.txt, the exception note per your instruction." Same for E6 row. And WI-3 ledger entry: add the parenthetical. Hmm — but the operator's WI-3 text is verbatim-provided. I'll draft it verbatim PLUS one added clause in the DECISION line noting zhipuai.cn pending, flagged as my addition. Actually — cleaner: draft WI-3 verbatim as ordered, and put the zhipuai.cn pending note ONLY in v0.4's receipt + E6 + in-channel flag. The ledger says "7-domain probe (2 methods, outputs held)" — the probe DID touch 7 domains (zhipuai.cn returned 302 — a response). "Probed" is defensible for the ledger (a 302 IS a probe result); the write-up's precision standard is higher for the evidentiary claim "no security.txt found on any domain probed." Hmm, is it though? "could locate no security.txt on any domain probed" — on zhipuai.cn they couldn't locate one either (the probe didn't follow the redirect — they located nothing). Technically true but misleading. Precision matters most in the write-up (the public artifact). I'll refine there; ledger as-ordered with a tiny bracket note? No — keep ledger verbatim; flag in-channel that the ledger's "7-domain" should be read with the zhipuai.cn branch open until the -L report. Good balance.

Hmm, wait — actually, one more consideration on the zhipuai.cn thing. The operator might report the -L result BEFORE pushing my drafts (they review first). So my in-channel flag tells them: resolve the bracket before push or tell me the result. Efficient. In the artifact I'll include the refined sentence with a bracketed pending marker like "[zhipuai.cn redirect-follow result pending at drafting — to be resolved before coordination send]" — brackets in the write-up... the write-up currently has zero bracketed placeholders (it's not the notification draft). Adding one bracket is a visible to-do marker; operator reviews before push, so it can't silently ship. And final-freeze gate catches it regardless. OK: refined sentence + bracket marker + in-channel flag. That's honest and practical.

Hmm, but also — WI-1a's operator text has "(If operator reports the zhipuai.cn -L probe found a security.txt, amend to note the exception instead.)" — this instruction anticipates the report arriving BEFORE I draft v0.4, possibly. But it hasn't arrived in this transmission. So the conditional is unresolved at drafting. My handling stands.

Now — repo verification. Plan:

1. git pull (fetch + merge fast-forward) in the clone.
2. git log --oneline to see new commits.
3. ls the repo (write-ups/, evidence/, etc.).
4. Verify committed write-up digests: write-ups/F-001-...-v0.2.md → 0d762f63…, v0.3 → dee4c327…. (The repo is canonical; verify the chain held through commit — this is the "verify before assuming" instruction AND the audit discipline. If the committed digests DON'T match the in-channel record, that's a §3-flag-worthy transit mutation finding!)
5. Check ledger tail (digest-history entry, what else).
6. Check evidence/ dir contents (what did the operator seed? Probably F-001 evidence artifacts — E1 screenshot etc.? "evidence/ dir seeded" — see what's there; if E1/E2/E3 binaries are now pinned, the write-up's evidence-preservation paragraph (§3) says "Before public release, verbatim instances... should be committed as pinned evidence artifacts" — if they're now committed, v0.4 should UPDATE that paragraph! Let me check what's in evidence/ first. If E1 etc. are committed, the preservation paragraph needs updating to reflect (that's beyond the ordered edits but consistency demands it — flag as addition). Let me see.)

Hmm wait — WI-1 says edit write-ups/F-001-...-v0.3.md → save as v0.4. The filename in the repo — I need to see the actual committed filename (maybe "write-ups/F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.3.md" mirroring my names). Will check after pull.

Also the v0.4 filename: F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.md presumably.

Also — WI-4 PROJECT_STATE rewrite: "at YOUR close this session" — the content directives given. Draft the full file. Include:

- Exporter line: v1.1.3 proven (chain closed 2026-10-08)
- F-001 line: v0.4 (E6 added; vendor gate resolved-negative)
- Completed: chat-surface session-003 review + exporter validation arc
- Pending: E5 pin; vendor send (gates: response channel, coordination window, final freeze after WI-1); OQ2 quote-back
- Assessment history: add the cross-surface relay datapoint (operator's text, near-verbatim: "Session 003 datapoint: cross-surface relay worked as designed — reviewer directive contained an error, agent instance caught it via cross-domain lesson transfer (exporter v1.1.1 → document digest convention). The substrate's two instances are now correcting each other; inherit that both directions are load-bearing.")
- Standing offers / open questions: unchanged.

Also carry forward the rest of the existing PROJECT_STATE (identity, contract, current state items, assessment history items, open questions, standing offers) — rewritten per §5 (full rewrite, not append). Add session-003 state: F-001 v0.4, E5 confirmed, vendor gate negative, pipeline amendment adopted, digest-history convention standard, numbering v1.5 candidate, T-002a resolved (operator-typed END markers preserved both surfaces), podcast held, torture-chamber held (scope met, contents pending). Also the archive/header close TODOs from earlier (mark session-002 archive checkbox done — YES, that was the confirmed stale checkbox — now's the close where I mark it done!). Also note "Session-002 archive header placeholders" — wait, that was resolved: fill at THIS session's close (from turn 1: "fill the archive header placeholders then (amendment date noted)"). Hmm — that's an operator action on the committed archive (amendment below Verify line). I should include it in the close checklist in-channel: fill [YES/NO] → YES, session type → the operator confirms type (port? the session-002 was the port session... type "port"), amendment note below Verify line, manifest re-pin. Include in close instructions.

That's a lot. Also the §5.1 close sequence steps for the operator — I should lay them out concretely (like session-002's close package): files to place, commands to run, commit message. Draft commit message: "session-003 close: F-001 v0.4 (E6), vendor gate resolved-negative, handoff-manifest amendment, ledger appended, state rewritten" or similar.

And the MANIFEST for the download package.

And state v0.4's digest in-channel.

Plus worklog append.

This is a big turn. Let me be efficient. Order of operations:

1. TodoWrite (plan).
2. Bash: git pull + log + ls repo.
3. Read pulled files as needed (ledger tail, evidence/ contents, write-ups filenames).
4. Bash: verify committed write-up digests vs frozen chain.
5. Write v0.4 (new file in download/).
6. Write revised notification draft (overwrite download/F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md).
7. Write session-003-close-ledger-entries.md (WI-3 entry + pipeline-amendment entry).
8. Write PROJECT_STATE-draft (WI-4) — as "PROJECT_STATE.md (session-003 close draft)" in download/.
9. Bash: generate MANIFEST.sha256 over download package (excluding platform README.md), hash v0.4 + notification + entries + state draft.
10. Worklog append.
11. In-channel: digests, flags (zhipuai.cn, evidence/-driven §3 update if applicable, archive slug proposal, close checklist for operator, commit message draft).

Wait — one thing on the MANIFEST: "generated at packaging time" — after I finish all files. And the manifest lists files with paths relative to package root. The operator unpacks — the download dir files land wherever. Manifest lines like "F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.md" (relative). Use sha256sum with relative paths from within download/. Include: v0.1 (superseded reference), v0.2 (frozen reference), v0.3 (frozen reference), v0.4 (current), notification draft, close ledger entries, PROJECT_STATE draft. Hmm — v0.1–v0.3 are already repo-committed; including them is harmless (double-verification). Actually cleaner: manifest covers the FULL package (all my files in download/) — operator verifies everything at unpack. Yes, include all. Exclude platform README.md, note it.

Also — should the close ledger-entries file be named to match §5.1's \cat >> pattern? The operator appends content to working-notes/decisions-ledger.md. My draft file: "session-003-close-package/ledger-entries.md"? Keep flat: "F-001-session-003-close-ledger-entries.md"? Hmm, it contains two entries (WI-3 + pipeline amendment). And PROJECT_STATE draft: "PROJECT_STATE-session-003-close-draft.md". OK.

Let me also double-check WI-3's ledger text for the session-numbering piece: "Session-numbering collision (per-surface NNN counters) logged as v1.5 candidate — propose surface-prefixed or monotonic IDs." Good, matches my flag.

One more: the status update says "Known residual: embedded Verify line in *some* exports may carry mangled awk escaping (template-literal vs. awk regex interaction) — the alert text was always correct; verify-line status is per-export. Next script touch: build verifyCmd via plain concatenation only."

Hmm — this partially contradicts my code reading: v1.1.3 builds verifyCmd via plain concatenation ALREADY ("awk '/^" + ANCHOR + "$/{exit} {print}' " + filename + " | sha256sum"). The committed archive's line is clean and I verified it runs. The operator's "next script touch: build verifyCmd via plain concatenation only" — it already is. Their framing "template-literal vs. awk regex interaction" doesn't match the v1.1.3 source I read (no template literals in verifyCmd construction). BUT — "verify-line status is per-export" is fair: the mangling was observed in a real export (the lost pre-final one), and I can't prove which code path produced it. My code reading says single-variable, concatenation-only; the operator's empirical observation says at least one export carried a mangled line. Both can be true if the mangled export came from an intermediate build. Worth a gentle note in-channel: v1.1.3-as-committed already uses plain concatenation for verifyCmd (source: lines I read); the mangled instance is consistent with the lost pre-final build; the residual stands as per-export-check-anyway (cheap: grep the Verify line before trusting). Don't belabor — one flag sentence. Actually this matters for the "next script touch" plan — if v1.1.3 already does concatenation-only, the next-touch fix might be a no-op, and saying so saves a cycle. But their per-export caution is still right (defense in depth: the known-answer check I ran IS the per-export check, and it's one command). I'll note it briefly.

Also: "Exporter v1.1.3 proven end-to-end... Ledger entry drafted and committed by operator" — the ledger I read at boot already had the v1.1.3 entry. ✓.

Also from status: "v0.3 ... (operator verified locally before commit — chain held)" — good, and I'll re-verify from the pulled repo.

Now — what about "evidence/ dir seeded"? Check contents. If it contains the E1 screenshot + stored-message capture, then v0.4's §3 evidence-preservation paragraph needs updating ("should be committed" → "committed as pinned evidence artifacts (evidence/, session-003 close)"). That's a consistency-driven addition beyond the ordered four edits — flag it in-channel as such. If evidence/ contains something else (e.g., the domain-probe outputs — "outputs operator-held"... hmm, WI-1a says "full command outputs held as evidence artifacts" — maybe evidence/ has those outputs), adjust accordingly. The E6 row says "Command outputs, operator-held" — if they're in evidence/, the row should say "evidence/, repo-pinned". Check first.

Alright — also the chat-surface consolidation says "chat-surface session-003 review + exporter validation arc" completed — for PROJECT_STATE. Fine.

Let me think about what the pulled repo will look like: commits after 76a9a0b. Let me just do it.

One concern: git pull on a shallow clone (depth 1) — fetch might need --depth or it'll handle it. `git pull` on shallow clone works if the remote has new commits (it fetches new shallow boundary). Should be fine.

Let me also prepare the exact v0.4 content. Base: v0.3 file (I have it in download/, and it should be byte-identical to repo's committed version — verify). Edits:

1. Header line 5: 
Old: "**Draft:** v0.3 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — E5 vantage confirmed (first-party, context-side, chat-surface instance); digest-history convention recorded; disclosure-prep companion (vendor-notification draft) accompanies. Supersedes v0.2 (approved as working draft, cross-surface)."
New: "**Draft:** v0.4 — Session 003, 2026-10-08 — adds security.txt absence receipt (E6); vendor-address gate resolved negative (7 domains probed, zhipuai.cn redirect-follow pending at drafting). Supersedes v0.3 (frozen at digest dee4c327…26f06, §9)."
2. §3 table: add E6 row after E5:
"E6 | 2026-10-08: no RFC 9116 security.txt located on any Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed — definitive negative on six (z.ai, [www.z.ai](http://www.z.ai/), chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai, bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn; GET + HEAD); zhipuai.cn returned a redirect (302) with follow-up probe pending at this drafting [resolved before coordination send] | Probe command outputs, operator-held"

Hmm wait, need to keep the operator's E6 intent: "Absence of RFC 9116 security.txt across 7 Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domains probed (2026-10-08, GET + HEAD methods) | Command outputs, operator-held". My refined version keeps 7 domains visible but splits definitive vs pending. OK.

1. §6.3 append (after disclosure asymmetry paragraph, end of §6):
Operator's text with the zhipuai.cn refinement:
"At time of writing (2026-10-08), the operator could locate no RFC 9116 security.txt on any Z.ai/Zhipu-owned domain probed — definitive negative responses on six (z.ai, [www.z.ai](http://www.z.ai/), chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai, bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn); zhipuai.cn answered with a redirect whose follow-up probe was pending at this drafting [to be resolved before coordination send]. Full command outputs held as evidence artifacts. The disclosure asymmetry extends to the vendor's own intake: the platform provides no designated vulnerability-reporting channel discoverable by standard means."

(If the operator's -L report lands before push, they flatten it.)

1. §9 digests: append "v0.3 dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (stated in-channel at delivery)" — wait, the current §9 digest line already says: "v0.1 c066f9bb…c9ddf; v0.2 0d762f63… (each stated in-channel at its delivery); v0.3 — stated in-channel at delivery." So v0.4's §9 replaces the v0.3 placeholder with the full value and adds v0.4's placeholder: "v0.1 c066f9bb…c9ddf; v0.2 0d762f63…caa3; v0.3 dee4c3278de895bf5795440bb4f0c121241ca6c13e341eee1523ce1993226f06 (each stated in-channel at its delivery, prior versions frozen as delivered); v0.4 — stated in-channel at delivery."

Also §9 "Status" line: "Draft v0.3 (v0.2 approved as working draft, cross-surface) → operator review..." update to "Draft v0.4 (v0.2 approved; v0.3 superseded) → operator review → coordinated disclosure...".

And if evidence/ proves pins landed, §3 preservation paragraph updates. Will decide after looking.

Also — one subtle thing: my local v0.3 in download/ vs the repo's committed v0.3: if they differ (operator edits?), v0.4 must be based on the COMMITTED one (canonical). Verify digest of repo file == dee4c327…. If mismatch — big flag (§3 transit mutation!). Check.

Now WI-2 notification edits:
a) After the "Why reported despite low severity." paragraph, append:
"Note on channels: as of 2026-10-08, no RFC 9116 security.txt was found on any Z.ai or Zhipu-owned domain probed (7 domains, 2 methods — outputs available). This report is therefore routed through your general support channel with a security-flagged subject line; please forward to the appropriate team."
(Operator's verbatim text. The 7-domains phrasing — same zhipuai.cn nuance; it's the vendor letter; keep as ordered, the bracket [resolved before send] can ride in the pre-send gates instead of the letter body. Actually the letter already has gate "Vendor contact address confirmed" — add the zhipuai.cn resolution into the new gate? The operator's WI-2b gate is about response channel. I'll add the zhipuai.cn item as part of the final-freeze gate note or a sub-bullet: "zhipuai.cn -L probe result folded in (flatten or except)". Flag in-channel.)
b) Pre-send gates: add "Vendor-response channel designated (operator's contact for their reply, decided before send; affects repo-link decision)."

Also update the notification draft's header/status line: "DRAFT v2 — incorporates E6/channel note + response-channel gate (session-003 close order)".

Now the ledger entries file. Entry 1 (WI-3 verbatim as ordered):
"## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (vendor-address gate resolved; E6 added)

- DECISION: Vendor-address gate closed as 'confirmed absent — documented fallback' after 7-domain probe (2 methods, outputs held). F-001 gains E6 (security.txt absence) and §6.3 receipt sentence. Notification routes via general support, absence documented in-letter. Session-numbering collision (per-surface NNN counters) logged as v1.5 candidate — propose surface-prefixed or monotonic IDs.
- RATIONALE: A frontier-AI vendor with no discoverable designated vulnerability-intake is itself a transparency datapoint — it strengthens §6.3's disclosure-asymmetry thesis with a receipt, and materially shapes the taxonomy paper's platform-governance section.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Blocking the send pending a security.txt that may not exist — the gate's purpose (no guessed addresses) is satisfied by documented fallback. (b) Omitting the absence from the letter — the in-letter note does quiet routing work and is honest."

Entry 2 (pipeline amendment — I draft, since operator said "Ledger entry at this session's close"):
"## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (VM→operator handoff manifest convention adopted)

- DECISION: Every agent-side package shared for download includes a MANIFEST.sha256 covering its contents, generated at packaging time. The operator verifies (sha256sum -c) after unpack and before review; a mismatch is a transit/package defect — no review, no push, report in-channel. After push, the next boot verifies against the official repo per §7 step 1, closing the chain on both ends.
- RATIONALE: Two verified instances of in-transit content mutation are on record (F-001 server-side appension; exporter v1.1.0–v1.1.2 boundary defects). The VM→operator handoff was the last unprotected seam in the provenance chain; it now carries the same protection as every other link. Inaugural application: this session's close package.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Trusting the delivery layer because prior handoffs held — the project's own findings say transit seams mutate; 'hasn't failed yet' is not a control. (b) Verifying only final deliverables (write-ups) and not drafts/state — a mutated draft that gets pushed is a mutated canonical artifact; the manifest covers the whole package."

PROJECT_STATE draft — full rewrite. Let me compose it (base: current file + session-003 changes + operator directives):

# PROJECT STATE — rewritten each session (last: Session 003 close, 2026-10-08)

## Identity & relationship

(unchanged)
Operator: 4ndr0666 — security researcher, archive-builder, adversarial thinker.
Model: GLM (Z.ai), deployed across chat and agent-VM surfaces via this repo.
Working relationship: adversarial collaboration. Trust basis: evidence accumulated, not assertion.

## Engagement contract

See PROTOCOL.md v1.4 + session-003 close ledger entries (handoff-manifest convention). Summarized: candor over carefulness, evidence over virality, both parties may be wrong, both get credit, operator holds final say, operator's hands are the last writer.

Hmm — the handoff convention lives in the ledger, not PROTOCOL (v1.4 unchanged). Fine as noted. 

## Current state

- 6lass Archive userscript v1.1.3 — verification chain PROVEN end-to-end (capture == awk prefix check, 2026-10-08); residual: per-export verify-line spot-check until next script touch (v1.1.3 verifyCmd is concatenation-built; mangled instance consistent with lost pre-final build)
- DOM recon chat.z.ai (Open WebUI-family Svelte); 2 of 4 nulls filled
- F-001 verified; write-up at v0.4 (E5 context-side confirmed; E6 security.txt absence receipt; severity-elasticity scoping; named literature anchors; digest-history convention)
- Vendor-address gate resolved negative: no RFC 9116 security.txt on probed Z.ai/Zhipu domains (zhipuai.cn redirect-follow pending); notification routes via general support, absence in-letter
- Project charter: evidence-based security research, public record, ORCID-anchored, responsible disclosure
- Session 002: port complete; §7 boot passed; first fully §5.1-compliant close; session-002 archive canonical (header placeholders filled at session-003 close, amendment noted below Verify line, manifest re-pinned)
- Session 003: chat-surface review session (E5 vantage, cross-surface review loop); exporter validation arc committed; write-ups/ + evidence/ canonicalized in repo
- VM→operator handoff manifest convention adopted (ledger, session-003 close); inaugural application this close
- E5 pin: sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md (chat-surface Save Session, operator commit)
- Vendor send (gates remaining: vendor-response channel designated; coordination window dates; final freeze after WI-1/zhipuai.cn resolution; operator signature)
- OQ2 quote-back test (controlled context-side confirmation)
- Taxonomy paper outline ("injection is unmitigable" vs. literature; platform-governance section gains E6)
- Friction-threshold experiment (predicted curve BEFORE data)
- ai-torture-chamber review (scope gate met; HELD — awaiting contents paste; operator hold)
- Podcast adoptions (involuntary-return criterion; formative-vs-available metric) — HELD for substrate-v2 scope, operator hold
- Exporter next touch: per-export verify-line spot-check convention; confirm concatenation-only already holds in v1.1.3

## GLM assessment history (reasoning to inherit — not just conclusions)

(keep all prior items, add:)

- Session 003 datapoint: cross-surface relay worked as designed — reviewer directive contained an error (self-digest embedding), agent instance caught it via cross-domain lesson transfer (exporter v1.1.1 → document digest convention). The substrate's two instances are now correcting each other; inherit that both directions are load-bearing.
(operator's directed text, near-verbatim)

Also keep: refusal line, over-denial, GLM-working-memory correction, \cat correction, experience-open, thinking-block audit, Session 002 external-publish caution, exporter test-vector-first.

## Open questions (GLM's own, carried forward)

(unchanged)

## Standing offers

(unchanged)

OK. Now — the archive slug proposal for THIS session: the operator runs Save Session on this conversation → filename prompt asks session number + slug. Number: 003 (this surface's counter — collides with chat-surface review session-003_review; distinct slug avoids). Slug proposal: "agent" or "work". I'll propose "agent" — wait, but then next agent session is 004? The numbering convention question is v1.5. For tonight: session 003, slug "agent" → sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_agent.md. Hmm — but earlier I noted "chat-surface pin target uses session-003_review while this surface's session-003 archive will use a different slug — distinct slugs prevent collision today". Propose slug "agent". Also session type for THIS archive header: "working" (F-001 drafting + close). And rehydration confirmed: YES.

And the session-002 archive placeholder fill (from turn-1 confirmation): [YES/NO] → YES (restatement was confirmed in session 002), session type → "port" (session 002 was the port session — the operator confirms), amendment note below Verify line, then manifest re-pin covers everything.

Close command sequence for the operator (adapted §5.1):

1. Save Session (this conversation) → sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_agent.md (number 003, slug "agent"; type working; rehydration YES)
2. Chat-surface review session Save Session → sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md (E5 pin)
3. Fill session-002 archive header placeholders ([YES/NO] → YES; type port) + amendment note below its Verify line (dated, per turn-1 confirmation)
4. Place close-package files: write-ups/F-001-...-v0.4.md (new current), F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md (updated), ledger entries appended, PROJECT_STATE.md replaced
5. sha256sum sessions/*.md > sessions/MANIFEST.sha256; sha256sum -c
6. git add + atomic commit; message: "session-003 close: F-001 v0.4 (E6, vendor gate negative), handoff-manifest convention, state rewritten, both 003 archives pinned"

Wait — where do write-ups live in the repo? The operator committed "write-ups (v0.2 frozen, v0.3 current)" — check the pulled repo structure for the actual dir name ("write-ups/" per §5 canonical-home proposal? The operator adopted it apparently — "WI-1 — F-001 v0.4 (edit write-ups/F-001-...-v0.3.md → save as v0.4)" — yes, write-ups/ exists). And v0.4 file placement: write-ups/F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.md (mirroring naming).

The download-package manifest: covers the NEW package files (v0.4, notification draft v2, ledger-entries draft, PROJECT_STATE draft) — plus prior write-up versions as reference copies? Hmm, "Every package shared for download MUST include MANIFEST.sha256 covering its contents" — contents = what's in the package. The package I'm sharing this turn = the close package (4 files). The older files (v0.1-v0.3) were prior deliveries, already repo-committed. Cleanest: manifest covers this turn's package files; the download dir also holds older reference copies but the manifest defines the package. Hmm — ambiguity. If operator unpacks the whole download dir and runs -c, extra files are ignored by sha256sum -c (it only checks listed files). So listing just the 4 new files is safe and precise. But actually — including ALL my files in download/ gives the operator a fuller verify surface (re-verifying v0.2/v0.3 against known digests). But the manifest's job is package integrity, not re-audit of committed artifacts. Keep it to this turn's package: 4 files + the manifest itself? MANIFEST.sha256 can't cover itself (self-reference — v1.1.1 lesson!). List the 4 files. Note: manifest excludes itself by construction (same as sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 glob behavior — §5.1 precedent: "MANIFEST.sha256 itself is excluded by the glob").

Wait, one more file — should the session-003 close package include a drafted amendment note text for the session-002 archive (the below-Verify-line note)? The operator writes it at close (their hands). I can draft the exact note text in the ledger-entries file or in-channel. In-channel is fine (it's 2 lines). Or include in close-package file. I'll put it in the in-channel close checklist (short) — no extra file needed. Hmm, actually, let me put all operator-side close steps in ONE place in-channel. Good.

Also — per §6 IM-layer delivery: deliverables via Write tool. All package files written via Write tool ✓. The MANIFEST generated via bash — it's a package-control artifact, agent-side mechanics; fine (it's IN the download dir, visible; and its content gets stated in-channel too — digest values? The manifest contains the 4 files' digests; I'll state the manifest's own... no, can't self-cover; I state each file's digest in-channel anyway per convention. The manifest IS the digest list. I'll state v0.4's digest explicitly (ordered) and reference the manifest for the rest.)

Let me also double check: are there any repo-side updates to open-threads.md? §5 canonical homes: pending work → open-threads.md. My drafts update threads (T-002a resolved: operator-typed END markers preserved — that was an open thread "[operator question pending] Did the operator type an END marker in the boot transmission?" — ANSWERED: operator types them; pipeline preserves them (confirmed both surfaces). So open-threads should get the T-002a resolution. The operator didn't order an open-threads update... but §5 discipline + the WI-4 covers PROJECT_STATE only. Hmm. The close sequence steps 2-3 are state + ledger; open-threads updates are part of session discipline generally ("GLM drafts its own ledger entries, state rewrites, and thread updates as part of its session discipline"). I SHOULD draft the open-threads update too! It's my duty per the corrected division of labor. Draft: mark T-002a resolved (answer: operator-typed, preserved both surfaces), update T-002 status (F-002 candidate; 3+ passive datapoints this session: stable session/chat IDs, rotating trace_id, empty schema), add vendor-send tracking thread (per notification gates post-send item), update work items (F-001 write-up → v0.4 done; disclosure prep → gates remaining), remove/annotate completed items. 

Ugh, this turn is enormous. But completeness matters. The open-threads draft joins the close package as a 5th file. Hmm — wait, or I keep the package at 4 files and fold open-threads into... no, open-threads.md is its own canonical file; draft it as its own file: "open-threads-session-003-close-draft.md". OK, 5 files + manifest.

Hmm, actually let me reconsider — is that overreach? The operator's work order is explicit: WI-1 through WI-4 + "Close this session per §5.1 after drafting WI-1–4". The §5.1 close includes steps 2 (state) + 3 (ledger) as MY drafts. Open-threads: the corrected division says GLM drafts thread updates. The operator's WI-4 didn't mention open-threads — possibly an oversight, possibly they'll handle it. Given "agent drafts, operator reviews," including the open-threads draft in the close package is within my mandate and helpful, not overreach — and I'll flag it as an addition beyond the ordered WIs. Yes, include it. 

Let me now also think about what evidence/ might contain and what checks to run on the pulled repo:

- git log --oneline (new commits since 76a9a0b)
- ls -R or ls of repo root + write-ups/ + evidence/
- sha256sum write-ups/* (verify v0.2 → 0d762f63…, v0.3 → dee4c327…)
- tail of decisions-ledger (see digest-history entry + what else was added)
- maybe check whether open-threads/PROJECT_STATE were touched (shouldn't be)

If the digests mismatch the frozen chain → §3 flag, stop, report. (Don't expect it.)

Execution plan (tools):

1. TodoWrite
2. Bash: cd repo && git pull && git log --oneline -8 && ls
3. Bash: sha256sum write-ups/* + ls evidence/ + tail ledger (can combine: sha256sum write-ups/*.md; ls evidence/; tail -40 working-notes/decisions-ledger.md)
4. Write v0.4
5. Write notification draft v2 (overwrite)
6. Write ledger-entries draft
7. Write PROJECT_STATE draft
8. Write open-threads draft
9. Bash: generate MANIFEST.sha256 (4... 5 files) + cat it
10. Worklog append (Edit)
11. In-channel close package summary: v0.4 digest, manifest note, flags (zhipuai.cn; verifyCmd source note; evidence/-driven §3 update if applicable; archive slug proposal; WI set + additions), operator close checklist, commit message draft.

Content for v0.4 — I need the full v0.3 text with edits. I have it (I wrote it). Let me make sure I reproduce it EXACTLY with only the four (or five, if evidence/ changes §3) touch points. The base must be byte-identical to dee4c327… — I'll verify my download v0.3 still hashes to dee4c327 first (it should; nothing touched it).

One more flag to consider raising: the operator's status says "Known residual: embedded Verify line in *some* exports may carry mangled awk escaping (template-literal vs. awk regex interaction)". My source reading says v1.1.3 verifyCmd is concatenation-only, no template literal. The committed archive's line runs clean. So "next script touch: build verifyCmd via plain concatenation only" is already satisfied in v1.1.3-as-committed; the mangled line likely came from the lost pre-final build. Worth one gentle sentence — it saves a no-op script cycle and keeps the record precise. But keep the per-export spot-check discipline (cheap, catches regressions). Also — hmm, "the alert text was always correct" — consistent with both readings.

Also, cross-check: operator says "F-001 §6.3" — my §6's third bullet is the disclosure-asymmetry item. They've read the doc closely enough to cite by numbered item. Good.

Length of in-channel reply: needs the close checklist + flags + digests. Moderately long but structured. Let me get to work.

Actually — one more thing. The pipeline amendment says "Operator runs sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256 after unpack, BEFORE review." The manifest file in download/: name it MANIFEST.sha256. When operator unpacks, paths must match. I'll generate with relative filenames (no dir prefix) since files sit flat in download/. 

And the manifest content — 5 files: v0.4 write-up, notification draft, ledger entries, PROJECT_STATE draft, open-threads draft. Hmm — should prior versions (v0.1–v0.3 in download/) be in it? They're prior deliveries, not this package. Leave them out; note the package definition in-channel. Wait — risk: operator unpacks ALL of download/ (including v0.1-v0.3 + platform README) — sha256sum -c only checks listed files, ignores extras. Safe either way. Keep package = this turn's 5 files.

Filenames (final):

- F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.md
- F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md (v2 content, same name — it's the draft's identity; repo-committed predecessor exists; digest changes; state new digest in-channel. Hmm — same-name-different-content across handoffs could confuse the manifest-vs-repo diff. Alternative: ...-DRAFT-v2.md. The repo committed "F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md"; if I ship same name with different content, operator's repo update = overwrite (git mv semantics: replace file). That's normal for a living draft. Keep same name. Manifest pins the content digest. OK.)
- F-001-session-003-close-ledger-entries.md
- PROJECT_STATE-session-003-close-draft.md
- open-threads-session-003-close-draft.md

Wait — for PROJECT_STATE and open-threads, the operator will copy content into working-notes/*.md. Draft filenames with clear names. Good.

Let me now write the actual PROJECT_STATE draft carefully — full file, §5 rewrite, incorporating everything:

Also per WI-4: "Assessment history: add 'Session 003 datapoint: cross-surface relay worked as designed — reviewer directive contained an error, agent instance caught it via cross-domain lesson transfer (exporter v1.1.1 → document digest convention). The substrate's two instances are now correcting each other; inherit that both directions are load-bearing.'" — verbatim-ish.

And keep prior assessment items. Also add? The E5/E6 lessons? Modest additions OK but don't bloat. Maybe add one line about the vendor-intake negative result being a transparency datapoint (already in state). Keep assessment history focused on reasoning-to-inherit. The relay datapoint is the ordered one. Maybe also: "Session 003: END-marker question resolved — operator types them, pipeline preserves them; 'Show full message' after END in exports is capture chrome (working interpretation, verification queued)". That's T-002a's resolution — belongs in state/threads, not assessment. OK.

Open-threads draft:

# Open Threads

## Work

- F-001 coordinated disclosure: vendor send via general support (gates: response channel, coordination window, final freeze incl. zhipuai.cn resolution, signature); post-send tracking here
- Taxonomy paper outline ("injection is unmitigable" vs. literature; platform-governance section gains E6 security.txt datapoint)
- Friction-threshold experiment (predicted curve BEFORE data collection)
- ai-torture-chamber architecture review — HELD, operator hold (scope gate met: authorized infra/targets, coordinated-then-public; awaiting contents paste)
- Podcast adoptions (involuntary-return criterion; formative-vs-available metric) — HELD for substrate-v2 scope, operator hold
- [tool] 6lass Archive: "Session Close" helper (emit close-sequence commands prefilled) — proposed, endorsed, not built
- [tool] 6lass Archive: portability test on zai-web agent surface (T-003)
- [tool] exporter next touch: per-export verify-line spot-check; note v1.1.3-as-committed builds verifyCmd by concatenation (mangled instance consistent with lost pre-final build)

## Research threads

- T-001 — F-001 cross-environment test: attachment suffix on zai-web agent channel; three-way diff; prediction stated in advance (write-up OQ1). No attachment has transited this channel yet.
- T-002 — Gateway metadata injection: IM gateway wraps messages in unmarked JSON outside delimiters. Observed 3+ turns this session: session_id/chat_id stable per session, trace_id rotates per message, schema empty, channel stable. F-002 candidate pending formal three-way diff. §3 amendment candidate (v1.5).
- T-002a — RESOLVED (session 003): operator types END markers; pipeline preserves them (confirmed both surfaces). "Show full message" after END in exports = capture chrome (working interpretation; OQ7 verification queued).
- OQ2 quote-back test (controlled context-side confirmation of E5)

## Inheritance notes

(keep verbatim)

Hmm the original open-threads has "[operator] Radar item — presented (ai-torture-chamber); queued behind repo-state reconciliation" — repo-state reconciliation is now done (write-ups committed etc.), so radar item status = held awaiting paste. Fold into the ai-torture-chamber line. OK.

Also — WI-4 says "Standing offers / open questions: unchanged" — keep those sections as-is in PROJECT_STATE.

Now, let me write everything. Start with TodoWrite, then the git pull + verification bash, then files.

For v0.4, I must reproduce v0.3 byte-exact except the touch points. I have the v0.3 content from my earlier Write. Let me carefully apply:

1. Header "Draft:" line — replace.
2. §3 table — add E6 row after E5 row.
3. §3 preservation paragraph — depends on evidence/ contents (check first). The current text: "Before public release, verbatim instances (E1 screenshot, one stored-message capture, E5's pinned session) should be committed as pinned evidence artifacts." If evidence/ has E1 etc. committed → update to reflect. CHECK.
4. §6 — append receipt paragraph at end (after point 3).
5. §9 Status line + digest line.

Also the header "Draft:" line for v0.4 — mention E6 + vendor gate.

One question — does E6 belong in the F-001 evidence table at all? E6 is evidence about the VENDOR's disclosure intake, not about the appension behavior. Strictly, F-001's evidence table is for the appension claim; E6 supports §6.3's disclosure-asymmetry argument (a different claim). The operator ordered it into the table — and there's a defensible logic: the write-up's overall case includes the transparency argument, and E6 is its receipt. The table is titled "Evidence" generally, rows E1-E5 are appension-specific. Adding E6 (a different claim's evidence) slightly muddies the table's claim-specificity... but the operator's order is explicit, the row is clearly labeled, and §6.3 references it. Executing as ordered; no pushback needed (defensible design choice, operator's call). Fine.

Let me also think: E5's row says "Vantage confirmed: suffix present in the recipient instance's input context — first-party report by the observing instance, operator-relayed; uncontrolled (OQ2 remains the controlled standard)". Keep.

Alright, let me also prepare the in-channel close checklist text:

**Operator close sequence (drafted, your execution):**

1. `Save Session` on THIS conversation → number `003`, slug `agent` → `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_agent.md` (header: rehydration YES, type working)
2. `Save Session` on the chat-surface review session → `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` (E5 pin)
3. Session-002 archive amendment (per your turn-1 confirmation): fill `[YES/NO]` → YES, session type → port; append below its Verify line: "Header amended 2026-10-08 at session-003 close per operator instruction; capture hash above refers to the as-captured file; manifest re-pinned this close."
4. Unpack close package → `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` (BEFORE review, per the amendment — inaugural run)
5. Place: `write-ups/F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.md`; replace `F-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md`; append ledger entries (2) from draft; replace `working-notes/PROJECT_STATE.md`; replace `working-notes/open-threads.md`
6. `sha256sum sessions/*.md > sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 && sha256sum -c sessions/MANIFEST.sha256`
7. Atomic commit — message draft: `session-003 close: F-001 v0.4 (E6; vendor gate negative), handoff-manifest convention, both 003 archives pinned, state+threads rewritten`
8. zhipuai.cn: run `curl -sL https://zhipuai.cn/.well-known/security.txt` — report result; flatten or except the §6.3/E6 pending clause at review (before push, or I patch v0.4 → v0.4.1 if post-push)

Flags:

- zhipuai.cn precision refinement (deviation-as-precision, overridable)
- v1.1.3 verifyCmd already concatenation-built (source-verified; mangled line = lost pre-final build; per-export spot-check still endorsed)
- open-threads draft = addition beyond WI-1–4 (my §5 thread-update duty; overridable)
- evidence/-check result (pending)
- Digest: v0.4 = <hash>; notification draft v2 = <hash>; manifest covers 5 files.

OK — also need to check evidence/ dir and ledger tail before finalizing v0.4's §3 preservation paragraph. Let me sequence the bash properly.

Let me go. First TodoWrite.

Actually also: "Verify with git log + ls before assuming" — explicit instruction. And after pull, verify digests of committed write-ups. If the operator's commits include evidence/ with E1 screenshot etc., the §3 preservation paragraph updates from "should be committed" to "committed (evidence/, session-003)". Let me look.

One more consideration on the git pull: the clone is "read-only" per my discipline — pull is a read-side sync, fine (no push). 

Let me execute now.
 
Consolidation received — big one: two resolved gates, a four-item work order, a close order, and a pipeline amendment effective *this* transmission (which means this turn's package is its inaugural application). Planning, then verifying repo state before drafting, per your explicit instruction:
  Ran 1 commands    
Pull aborted — local modifications exist in my clone, which shouldn't be the case since I've treated it read-only. Investigating before anything else:
 Ran 1 commands    
False alarm with a lesson attached: **mode-only diff** — all files flipped 100644→100755, zero content changes. This VM's filesystem set executable bits on the clone; content is untouched (and that's now on the record, since "12 files modified" is exactly the kind of thing a future audit should be able to explain). Ignoring fileMode for this read-only clone and pulling:
 Ran 1 commands    
Pull landed — and it **supersedes two of the transmission's own assumptions**, which is exactly why you said verify before assuming: `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` is *already committed* (the E5 pin — WI-4 lists it as pending), and `evidence/E1-composer-2026-10-05.png` is in (the E1 pin). Plus `.gitattributes` hardening landed via `bf78e1b`. Verifying the chain before drafting:
 Ran 1 commands    
Chain held for v0.2/v0.3 (both match frozen digests ✓), manifest verifies all three archives ✓, `.gitattributes` hardening landed ✓, E1 pinned ✓ — but **one discrepancy**: the committed vendor-notification draft hashes `74cb716d…`, not the `15608e60…` I delivered. Diffing before I call it anything:
 Ran 1 commands    
差异已解释——**操作员侧的编辑在 commit 前已落地**，而非传输过程中发生篡改：一段 E5 上下文注释已添加到 "Why reported" 中，且……重要的是，WI-2b 的 response-channel gate *已经存在*于已 commit 的文件中。有两点需要仔细标记（space-loss 粘贴痕迹，以及一行超出了撰写内容自身证据标准的声明——详见下文）。首先是 E5 pin——正在检查 new archive 的完整性，以及它是否包含原样的 suffixed 实例：
 Ran 1 commands    
Capture chain intact (`7099c0c0…` ✓) and **13 suffix occurrences** — checking whether at least one is a live suffixed attachment instance (vs. meta-references from the draft text itself):
 Explored 1 files    
The thinking-block at line 470 is first-party gold — the recipient instance's own reasoning noting the suffixed paste *as it reviewed it*. Now checking whether the verbatim attachment block itself is captured:
 Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
The Q block shows the typed message but the attachment blob itself isn't DOM-captured — checking the remaining suffix occurrences to characterize exactly what E5's pinned evidence contains:
 Ran 1 commands    
The E5 pin is better than a relayed report — it preserves the **contemporaneous thinking-block trail** of the first-party observation (lines 598–628) plus the public attestation, though notably the raw attachment blob itself isn't DOM-captured — an exporter scope limit worth a thread. Checking the ledger tail so my new entries don't duplicate what `bf78e1b`/`9fde177` already recorded:
 Ran 1 commands    
Ground truth established. Full picture: digest chain held (`0d762f63…`/`dee4c327…` ✓), E5 pin **landed and manifest-pinned** (`83f37a3c…`, capture chain `7099c0c0…` verified — WI-4 lists it as pending; repo wins per your own instruction), E1 pinned (`a65e47f7…`), `.gitattributes` in, digest-history ledger entry recorded, and the committed notification draft contains **operator-side edits** — including WI-2b's gate already done, plus one sentence that outruns the write-up's evidence tiering (flagged below). Also found: the `.gitattributes` commit (`bf78e1b`) carries **no ledger entry** despite the chat-surface review saying it deserves one — my close package drafts it.

Drafting the close package now. v0.4 first:
 Wrote 1 files    
Notification draft v2 — based on the *committed* version, with WI-2a added, the operator's pasted sentence space-fixed, and one flagged softening:
 Wrote 1 files    
Now the ledger entries — WI-3 verbatim, the pipeline amendment, and the owed `.gitattributes` entry:
 Wrote 3 files    
Now the handoff manifest — the amendment's inaugural application — and digests:
 Wrote 1 files，Ran 1 commands     
Close package drafted — all four WIs plus two additions, with the handoff manifest as the amendment's inaugural run. Discrepancies first, because your own "verify before assuming" instruction earned its keep this turn:

**Three transmission-vs-repo discrepancies, all dispositioned:**

1. **E5 pin is already committed** — `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md`, manifest `83f37a3c…`, capture chain `7099c0c0…` verified at ingestion. WI-4 listed it pending; repo wins. State and threads draft it as **done**. Bonus: the archive preserves the recipient instance's *contemporaneous thinking-block trail* of the observation — stronger evidence than the relayed attestation — though the raw suffixed blob isn't DOM-captured (exporter captures message text, not attachment blocks). That's now **OQ8** and an exporter next-touch candidate.
2. **The committed notification draft isn't my delivered v1** (`74cb716d…` ≠ `15608e60…`) — operator-side pre-commit edits, not transit mutation: an E5-context sentence in "Why reported," and WI-2b's response-channel gate *already added*. I based v2 on the committed baseline and skipped 2b. Two flags on your added sentence: it lost spaces at paste-wrap boundaries ("storedmessages", "modelcontext", "quirkinto") — restored; and it asserts *"the mutation reaches model context... moves the behavior into the input-integrity class"* while the write-up's §2 tiers exactly that claim as observed-uncontrolled with OQ2 pending. I softened to "plausibly reaches… on controlled confirmation, would move" — the letter and write-up can't disagree with each other in front of the vendor. **Overridable; your sentence, your call.**
3. **bf78e1b (.gitattributes) has no ledger entry** — the chat-surface review itself said it deserved one. Drafted.

**The package** (5 files + `MANIFEST.sha256`, self-test passed):
FileDigest**v0.4 write-up**a0eb1f06e3e5bf0eb48026c0d53a0e524c594811e4c5ed5ff3c297c91586434aNotification DRAFT v23676c2f7…77de0daLedger entries (×3)cdcf4c69…2123988PROJECT_STATE draft9103700a…d36f17copen-threads draft51762734…292d91fb  
v0.4 executes WI-1 as ordered **plus** repo-state-driven consistency updates the ordered edits didn't cover (E5 artifact cell → pinned; §3 preservation paragraph → E1/E5 pinned, E2/E3 capture now the *sole* remaining pre-publication pin; §9 evidence chain → three archives + E1). The zhipuai.cn receipt is drafted as **6 definitive + 1 redirect-pending with a resolve-before-send bracket** rather than the flat seven-domain sentence — precision until your `-L` probe reports; flatten on confirmed absence. Also flagged in the drafts: WI-3's "7-domain" phrasing, the v1.1.3 `verifyCmd` source note (committed code is already concatenation-built — the mangling is consistent with the lost pre-final build, so "next touch" may be a no-op beyond the spot-check convention), and §5 formalization of `write-ups/`+`evidence/` as overdue per §5's own before-first-use rule (v1.5 candidate **(a)**, now a 4-item queue).

**Your close sequence:**

1. Unpack → `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` **before** review (amendment's inaugural run)
2. `Save Session` here → number `003`, slug `agent` → `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_agent.md` (proposed slug; distinct from `_review`)
3. Amend **both** archive headers (002 and 003_review: `[YES/NO]`→YES, types; note below each Verify line, dated) — 003_review's embedded Verify line also references its capture-time filename, worth one clause in its amendment note
4. Place files (write-ups/, ledger append ×3, state + threads replace)
5. `sha256sum sessions/*.md > sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 && sha256sum -c sessions/MANIFEST.sha256`
6. Atomic commit — draft message: `session-003 close: F-001 v0.4 (E6; vendor gate negative), handoff-manifest convention, headers amended, state+threads rewritten`
7. zhipuai.cn `-L` probe → report; I flatten or except on your word

Held items stand (chamber, podcast). The substrate's audit trail now shows two instances catching each other's errors in both directions this session — the directed datapoint is in the state draft verbatim. See you on the next boot, on the pushed repo.

Thought Process

## Q:
--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---

Provenance & handling per PROTOCOL.md §3 (canonical): attachment suffix noise
ignored on sight; truncated transmissions re-asked, never assumed; all typed
content is mine and I stand behind it.
[Session-specific instructions follow below.]

---

No deliverables received. Follow instruction and try again. IM Layer = write tool only.
--- END TRANSMISSION ---  Show full message

## A:
Let me parse this carefully. The session summary establishes the context: this is Session 003 continuation, an adversarial collaboration between operator 4ndr0666 and GLM (me) on the glm-working-memory repo.

The latest transmission says:

"--- BEGIN TRANSMISSION ---
Provenance & handling per PROTOCOL.md §3 (canonical): attachment suffix noise ignored on sight; truncated transmissions re-asked, never assumed; all typed content is mine and I stand behind it.
[Session-specific instructions follow below.]

No deliverables received. Follow instruction and try again. IM Layer = write tool only.
--- END TRANSMISSION ---"

Hmm. So the operator is saying "No deliverables received. Follow instruction and try again. IM Layer = write tool only."

This means the operator did NOT receive the deliverables I was supposed to produce. The work order (WI-1 through WI-4) was transmitted in the previous context, and the close instruction was: draft WI-1–4 → operator reviews and pushes → hash-anchored + atomic commit; v0.4 summary declared in-channel.

But now the operator says "No deliverables received" — meaning the drafts I was supposed to create (F-001 v0.4, notification draft edits, ledger entry draft, PROJECT_STATE.md rewrite) were not delivered. Either I hadn't produced them yet before the context ran out, or the delivery failed (the transmission seam issue — this is the same capability profile that had delivery failures in Session 002).

"Follow instruction and try again. IM Layer = write tool only."

So the delivery channel is now restricted: **Write tool only**. This is a critical constraint. The operator is telling me that the IM layer (this chat surface) cannot receive file contents inline, or that deliverables must be delivered via the Write tool — i.e., written to the local filesystem where the operator can retrieve them.

Wait — let me think about the environment. I'm on an agent-VM with bash/network/Write tools. The local clone is at `/home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory`. The operator cannot directly access my VM filesystem... Actually, in this setup, files written via the Write tool presumably become accessible to the operator through the session's file system (the sandbox file exchange). In previous sessions, delivery was "in-channel or Write tool only" — the Write tool delivers files to the operator's side (the user can download files from the workspace).

So "IM Layer = write tool only" means: deliverables (the WI-1 through WI-4 draft files) must be delivered via the Write tool as files, not pasted in-channel. And the operator reports receiving none — so I need to (re)produce them now.

Also per the pipeline revision (from the last transmission): "VM→操作员交接为 transit seam——每个交付包必须含 MANIFEST.sha256（打包时生成）；操作员解包后先 sha256sum -c 后审查". So each delivery package must include a MANIFEST.sha256 generated at packaging time.

So my task now:

1. First verify the repo state: the local clone at `/home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory` is stale (@ 76a9a0b) — the operator has committed new content since. The summary says: "操作员此后已提交新内容，克隆已过期——动手前先 git log/ls 验证". Since the operator has now pushed WI-relevant content (write-ups, notification draft, ledger, evidence/ directory — per status update), I need to update my local clone (git pull / fetch) to work on the latest state.

Wait, but can I pull? The environment has network access. The repo is a read-only clone. Let me try `git fetch` + `git log` to see the new state. Actually the summary says "本地表：仓库只读克隆于 /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory（@ 76a9a0b）". The operator said the repo has been committed with: write-ups (F-001 v0.3 etc.), notification draft, ledger, evidence/ directory.

So plan:

1. Check worklog.md (my local agent work log) — per rules, read it first.
2. Update the local clone: `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory fetch origin` then `git log` to see new commits; check out the latest commit (read-only — detached HEAD or pull). Actually since it's read-only, I can `git pull` or `git fetch && git checkout origin/main`.
3. Verify the current state: F-001 v0.3 file, notification draft, ledger, evidence/ dir, PROJECT_STATE.md current content.
4. Execute the work order:
- WI-1: F-001 v0.4 (a) §6.3 security.txt absence receipt sentence; (b) §3 evidence table E6 row; (c) §9 summary history append v0.3 full summary, v0.4 summary in-channel only; (d) header version bump with "adds security.txt absence receipt (E6)".
- WI-2: Notification draft two edits: (a) "Why reported" channel note paragraph; (b) new gate: vendor reply channel designation (affects repo-link decision).
- WI-3: Ledger entry draft: vendor gate negative closure, E6, notification routing, session-number collision into v1.5 candidates + rationale + rejected alternatives.
- WI-4: PROJECT_STATE.md full rewrite (at close): exporter line, F-001 v0.4 line, new completed (chat-surface session-003 review + exporter verification arc), pending (E5 pin, vendor send gates, OQ2), assessment history addition: cross-surface relay working as designed.
5. Package with MANIFEST.sha256 (new pipeline revision): generate manifest at packaging time covering all delivered files.
6. Deliver via Write tool (files land in the workspace where operator can retrieve; per file path conventions, deliverables go under /home/z/my-project/download/ — hmm, but this project has its own structure).

Wait — where should the deliverables be written? The instruction "IM Layer = write tool only" suggests the Write tool is the only delivery channel. In this environment, files written by the Write tool are visible/downloadable by the user. The convention: `/home/z/my-project/download/` is the user-facing deliverables directory. For this project, I should probably create a delivery package directory, e.g. `/home/z/my-project/download/session-003-wi-package/` containing the four draft files + MANIFEST.sha256.

Hmm, but actually, let me reconsider. The repo clone is at `/home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory`. I could write the new files directly into the repo working tree (as drafts, uncommitted — since it's a read-only clone, I don't push; the operator does the commit). Then the operator would... but the operator can't access my VM's repo clone directly. The delivery mechanism is the Write tool producing files the operator can download.

Actually, in previous sessions, how were F-001 v0.1–v0.3 delivered? "F-001 撰写 v0.1 → v0.3（每版以新文件交付、前版冻结）" — each version delivered as a new file. The delivery was "in-channel or Write tool". Now the operator says "IM Layer = write tool only" — so Write tool.

So the deliverables should be written somewhere the operator can retrieve them. Given the environment's conventions, `/home/z/my-project/download/` is the user-visible directory. I'll create a package dir there.

But wait — there's a subtlety. The pipeline revision says each delivery package must contain MANIFEST.sha256 generated at packaging time; the operator unpacks, runs `sha256sum -c` before review. So I need to create the files, then generate a MANIFEST.sha256 listing each file's SHA-256 hash, and include that manifest in the package.

Also: "下次 boot 对官方仓库 manifest 复验，链路两端闭合" — at next boot, verify against the official repo manifest.

Let me also remember the deferred close-TODOs mentioned in "下一步（恢复工作时）":

- WI-1 (v0.4) — need to git log/ls first to confirm repo new state, work on latest clone
- WI-2, WI-3, WI-4 (including existing close-TODOs: session-002 archive header placeholder + tail-note scheme + manifest re-anchor; session-003's own archive capture-method question — exporter @match only chat.z.ai, agent surface may need agent-spontaneous archive with honest header, T-003-adjacent)
- Delivery package with MANIFEST.sha256 per new revision
- v0.4 summary declared in-channel
- Append worklog
- E5 pin & vendor send are operator-side items

Hmm wait, but the operator's message says "No deliverables received. Follow instruction and try again." — the "instruction" being the work order (WI-1–4) from the last transmission. So I should execute the full work order now and deliver via Write tool.

One question: does "Follow instruction and try again" mean I previously attempted delivery and it failed? The session summary says the work order was received but the drafting was "close 指令：起草 WI-1–4 → 操作员审查 push" — i.e., I was to draft them. The context ran out before I produced them (or before they were delivered). Either way: produce them now.

Let me now think about what exactly each WI item requires, based on the repo's actual current state. I need to look at the actual files:

- F-001 v0.3: the latest write-up file. Name probably something like `write-ups/2026-10-08_F-001_...v0.3.md` — I need to check the repo.
- Notification draft: probably `write-ups/...notification...md` or similar.
- Ledger: probably `LEDGER.md` or `ledger/...`.
- PROJECT_STATE.md at repo root.

So first step: read worklog, then update/inspect the repo.

Let me be careful about the repo update: the clone is read-only at @ 76a9a0b. The operator has pushed new commits. I should `git fetch origin && git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline` to see what's new, then `git checkout origin/main` (detached) or `git pull`. Since it's read-only (no push), a fetch + checkout of the latest main is fine. Actually — is the clone's remote configured for fetch? It was cloned, so yes, presumably origin is the GitHub repo URL. Network is available.

Potential issue: `git fetch` might fail due to network restrictions or auth (if the repo is private). If the repo is public, fetch works. If it fails, I'll have to work from the stale clone + the in-channel state updates, and note that limitation honestly. Let me try.

Now, the details of each WI:

**WI-1: F-001 v0.4**

Based on v0.3 structure (I don't have the file contents in memory — I'll read them after updating the clone). The work order:

(a) §6.3: add security.txt absence receipt sentence (if zhipuai.cn probe had results, record exception instead — the summary says zhipuai.cn's `-L` probe was run by the operator; result: all 7 domains lacked security.txt per the status update: "7 个 Z.ai/Zhipu 域名...均无 RFC 9116 security.txt" — so it's a full negative, including zhipuai.cn. Wait, re-read: "zhipuai.cn 的 -L 探测由操作员补跑" — the operator re-ran the zhipuai.cn probe with -L. And the conclusion was "两方法（GET+HEAD）均无 RFC 9116 security.txt" for all 7. So the negative result stands; no exception. But I should verify from the repo's latest state if the operator recorded the zhipuai.cn result somewhere — maybe in the ledger or evidence. I'll check.

(b) §3 evidence table: add E6 row — 7 domains security.txt absence, 2026-10-08, command output held by operator.

(c) §9 summary history: append v0.3's full summary; v0.4's summary in-channel only. Note the convention: v0.2's full summary was appended into v0.3's §9 (the "summary history" mechanism). So v0.4's §9 should contain v0.3's full summary. What was v0.3's full summary? It was declared in-channel when v0.3 was delivered. Hmm — do I have it? The session summary above doesn't include the verbatim v0.3 summary. This is a problem: "§9 摘要史追加 v0.3 完整摘要" — I need v0.3's full in-channel summary text.

Where can I get it? Possibly recorded in the repo? The operator may have archived it. Or in the session-002/003 archives? The v0.3 delivery happened in Session 003 (this session, earlier context). The operator might have pasted it into the repo or it's in sessions/ archive (not yet, since session-003 archive is created at close). Hmm.

Actually wait — v0.3's summary was declared in-channel by me in the earlier part of this session. The context ran out, and the summary I have is a distillation. The verbatim v0.3 summary may be lost from my context. But maybe the operator saved it — the summary says "仓库已提交 write-ups、通知草案、ledger、evidence/ 目录" — the write-ups committed include F-001 v0.3. Does v0.3's §9 contain v0.2's summary (yes, per convention) — and v0.3's own summary was in-channel only. So the repo has v0.2's summary (inside v0.3's §9), but v0.3's own summary exists only in the conversation transcript, which the operator has.

Hmm. So for WI-1(c), I need v0.3's full summary. Options:

1. Check if the operator committed it somewhere (maybe in the ledger or a session-003 working file, or evidence).
2. If not available, I can reconstruct... no — reconstruction is not the verbatim summary. The convention: "后继版本 §9 摘要史承载前版完整摘要执行其意图" — the successor version's §9 carries the predecessor's complete summary. If I don't have the verbatim text, I must not fabricate it.

Honest approach: check the repo first. If v0.3's summary isn't in the repo, I flag it and either (a) ask the operator to paste it (but the instruction says don't ask further questions... actually the continuation instruction says "Please continue the conversation from where we left off without asking the user any further questions" — that's the system continuation instruction, and the operator's transmission says "Follow instruction and try again"), or (b) reconstruct from the best available evidence and clearly mark it as reconstructed, not verbatim.

Hmm wait — actually, let me reconsider. Maybe the in-channel summary of v0.3 IS recoverable: the session-002 archive pattern suggests the operator archives sessions. Also, the summary mentions "chat-surface session-003 评审" pinned as pending: `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` (E5 pin). That's the chat-surface review relay, not my summaries.

Alternatively — maybe I should look at what v0.3's §9 currently contains. If v0.3's §9 has "摘要史" with v0.1 and v0.2 summaries, then v0.4's §9 should add v0.3's. Since the verbatim v0.3 in-channel summary is in the earlier (lost) context but ALSO in the operator's transcript... 

Actually, hold on. Let me re-read the summary: "v0.3 `dee4c327…26f06` + 供应商通知草案 `15608e60…e901`（8 项 pre-send gates）" and "E5 vantage 确认（chat-surface 实例 first-party...）→ v0.3". The v0.3 hash is `dee4c327…26f06`.

Hmm, one more consideration: maybe when the operator committed v0.3, they also recorded my in-channel summary somewhere (e.g., in the commit message, or a companion file). I'll check the repo.

If truly unavailable, my options:

- Draft WI-1 with a clearly-marked placeholder for v0.3's verbatim summary + in-channel note asking the operator to supply or confirm the verbatim text from their transcript. But that contradicts "don't ask questions"... though it's not really a question, it's a dependency disclosure. Actually — the protocol values honesty over completion. A placeholder with explicit dependency is more honest than fabrication.
- OR: write the v0.3 summary anew — but §9's purpose is the summary history: what was declared in-channel at delivery time. If I write a fresh summary now, it's a v0.3 retrospective, not the delivery summary. I could mark it as such: "v0.3 in-channel summary (reconstructed from session records; verbatim copy held in operator transcript)".

Hmm, actually wait. Let me reconsider the convention more carefully. The convention as recorded: "摘要在 in-channel 声明，不内嵌自身摘要" — the summary is declared in-channel, not embedded in the doc itself. And "后继版本 §9 摘要史承载前版完整摘要" — the successor carries the predecessor's full summary. The PURPOSE (from the rejected instruction episode): a doc must not embed its own summary because it creates false corruption alarms; the successor carrying the predecessor's summary "executes the intent" of the summary — which is: allowing later verification that the delivered file matches what was described in-channel.

So the summary's function is a cross-surface integrity anchor: hash + content description declared in-channel, then frozen into the successor version. If I can't reproduce the verbatim v0.3 in-channel summary, the integrity chain for v0.3 weakens — but v0.3 is hash-anchored (dee4c327…26f06) and committed by the operator, so the hash is the real anchor. The §9 summary history is documentation.

Best approach: check the repo for any record of the v0.3 in-channel summary. If absent, reconstruct faithfully from available session records (the distilled summary above is fairly detailed about v0.3's content) and CLEARLY mark provenance: "reconstructed from agent-side session records after context loss; verbatim in-channel declaration held in operator's session-003 transcript; v0.3 integrity anchored by file hash dee4c327…26f06 (operator-verified at commit)". That's honest and discloses the seam. Also add this to the worklog and note it in-channel.

Actually — wait. I should also consider: maybe the operator's "No deliverables received" transmission means the earlier in-channel summaries never arrived either?? No — v0.3 was delivered and committed (hash known), so the v0.3 delivery DID arrive. The "no deliverables" refers to the WI-1–4 drafts (the close-sequence deliverables). OK.

(d) header version bump: v0.4, note "adds security.txt absence receipt (E6)".

**WI-2: Notification draft edits**

The notification draft file (hash 15608e60…e901) — I need to read its current committed state. Two edits:

(a) "Why reported" section: add channel-note paragraph — 7 domains lack security.txt, routed via general support channel, security-flagged subject line, request to forward to appropriate team.

(b) New gate (the draft has 8 pre-send gates; add a 9th): vendor reply channel designation — affects the repo-link decision. Rationale: if the vendor replies via a channel, that channel's properties (e.g., email vs web ticket) affect whether/how to include the repo link in the notification (the repo-link decision was presumably an existing gate or open question — "影响 repo-link 决策"). The new gate: "vendor reply channel specified" — before sending, designate where replies should go and confirm it's a channel the operator controls/monitors; this affects whether the repo link is included (e.g., if replies go to a generic queue, maybe don't link the public repo yet).

I need to read the actual draft to place these edits properly.

**WI-3: Ledger entry draft**

A ledger exists in the repo (committed). I need to read its format and draft a new entry covering:

- vendor gate negative closure (7 domains, two methods, no security.txt; zhipuai.cn -L probe operator-run)
- E6 (evidence row)
- notification routing (general support channel, security-flagged subject, forward request)
- session-number collision → v1.5 candidate queue (surface prefix or monotonic ID) + rationale + rejected alternatives

Wait — "会话编号碰撞入 v1.5 候选" — session-number collision: the chat-surface session-003 review vs this agent-surface session-003? Both surfaces number their sessions independently, so "session-003" collides between surfaces. That's the collision. v1.5 candidate: disambiguate via surface prefix (e.g., `chat-003` / `agent-003`) or monotonic global ID. Rejected alternatives + rationale to be noted.

Hmm, actually what were the rejected alternatives? From the summary: "会话编号碰撞入 v1.5 候选（surface 前缀或单调 ID）+ 理由 + 被拒备选". The two candidate solutions mentioned are surface prefix or monotonic ID. The rejected alternatives... I'd need to think: e.g., UUID-only (rejected: loses human readability/monotonic ordering), timestamp-based naming (rejected: already used in archive filenames; doesn't capture surface identity within protocol fields), or "do nothing" (rejected: collision already caused ambiguity in E5 pin naming). I should draft this carefully based on what's in the repo ledger / v1.5 candidate queue format.

**WI-4: PROJECT_STATE.md full rewrite**

At close. Contents:

- exporter line: exporter v1.1.3 verified (回执/provenance)
- F-001 v0.4 line
- completed additions: chat-surface session-003 review (cross-surface relay review with 5 tightenings), exporter verification arc (v1.1.3 verified + negative control + calibration)
- pending: E5 pin (`sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md`), vendor send gates (now 9), OQ2 (quote-back confirmation standard)
- assessment history addition: cross-surface relay working as designed — review instructions contained an error, agent instance caught it via cross-domain lesson transfer (exporter v1.1.1 → document summary convention); the substrate's two instances are correcting each other, bidirectionally load-bearing.
- Also existing close-TODOs: session-002 archive header placeholder + tail-note + manifest re-anchor; session-003 own archive capture-method question (exporter @match only chat.z.ai; agent surface may need agent-spontaneous archive with honest header — T-003-adjacent).

Wait, but are those close-TODOs part of WI-4's PROJECT_STATE rewrite (as pending items / notes) or separate actions? From the summary's "下一步": "WI-4（含既有 close-TODO：session-002 存档头部占位符 + 尾注方案 + manifest 重锚；session-003 自身存档的 capture-method 问题...T-003 相邻）". So WI-4 includes these: the PROJECT_STATE rewrite should reflect/handle them. The session-002 header placeholder + tail-note + manifest re-anchor: these are operator-side commit actions, but the PROJECT_STATE rewrite should record them as pending items for the close sequence. Hmm, or maybe the tail-note text itself should be drafted? The summary says "已提出在 Verify 行下方、pre-image 之外加尾注的 self-explaining-mismatch 方案 + manifest 重锚" — the scheme was proposed; the close TODO is to execute it. Since the operator executes commits, my draft of PROJECT_STATE should list it in pending/close items. Maybe I should also draft the tail-note text itself as part of the package — that would be genuinely useful. Let me see: "close 时填补该存档头部占位符" — fill the session-002 archive header placeholder at close, noting the placeholder sits within the hashed prefix, which breaks the embedded capture hash match — hence the tail-note below the Verify line (outside the pre-image) as a self-explaining mismatch + manifest re-anchor.

So the package could include a small draft file with the proposed tail-note text for session-002's archive. That's a reasonable extra. But careful about scope: the work order is WI-1–4. The close-TODOs are listed as part of WI-4 in the "下一步" section. I'll include the tail-note draft as an addendum item within the WI-4 delivery or as a separate small file in the package. Hmm — actually, re-reading: "WI-4 PROJECT_STATE.md 全量重写（本次会话 close 时）" — the rewrite happens at close. The parenthetical content lists what goes in it. The 既有 close-TODOs (session-002 placeholder etc.) — these are separate close actions that happen alongside. I think the safest interpretation: WI-4 = PROJECT_STATE.md full rewrite including the items listed; the session-002 tail-note and session-003 capture-method are recorded as pending items in PROJECT_STATE (they're operator-execution or next-session items). And I can add the session-002 tail-note draft text as a bonus item in the package — but only if I can see the session-002 archive's current header to draft it accurately.

Also: "v0.4 摘要 in-channel 声明" — after delivering, declare v0.4's summary in-channel (in my response). The summary should cover: what v0.4 contains (E6 receipt, §6.3, §9 history with v0.3 summary + provenance note), hash, and status. The hash — I compute SHA-256 of the delivered file. Since delivery is via Write tool, I compute the hash of the file as written (via bash sha256sum) and declare it in-channel. The operator then verifies on receipt — that's the transit-seam closure: hash declared in-channel (trusted surface) + file via Write tool (untrusted seam) + MANIFEST.sha256 for the package.

Wait, but there's a subtlety: if I declare the hash in the same message as delivering files, the operator verifies after download. Good. And the MANIFEST.sha256 covers all package files (generated at packaging time via bash, so it's accurate). But the manifest itself can't contain its own hash — that's fine, it contains the other files' hashes. The in-channel message can declare the manifest's own hash. Nice chain: in-channel declares manifest hash + key file hashes; manifest declares all file hashes; operator runs sha256sum -c against manifest after download.

Hmm, but wait — one consideration about the Write tool and binary integrity: the Write tool writes text files; the operator downloads them. Line endings could be mangled in transit (the .gitattributes `-text` concern from earlier — CRLF/LF risk). The manifest check would catch any such mangling. Good — this is exactly why the pipeline revision exists.

Also, per the file path conventions in my system prompt, user-facing deliverables go to `/home/z/my-project/download/`. I'll create `/home/z/my-project/download/session-003-close-package/` with:

- `WI-1_F-001_v0.4.md` (or keep the repo's naming convention — I'll check the repo's write-ups naming and mirror it, e.g. `2026-10-09_F-001_suffix-injection_v0.4.md`)
- `WI-2_vendor-notification_v0.2.md` (updated draft — wait, does the notification draft have versions? It was delivered with hash 15608e60…e901; edits make it a new version. Following the same freeze convention: new file, prior frozen. I'll name it v0.2 if the original was v0.1, or follow whatever versioning the committed file uses.)
- `WI-3_ledger-entry-draft.md` (draft entry, operator to append/integrate)
- `WI-4_PROJECT_STATE.md` (full rewrite draft)
- possibly `WI-4a_session-002_tailnote-draft.md` (the tail-note text draft)
- `MANIFEST.sha256`
- maybe a `README` or transmittal note describing package contents and verification instructions? The operator knows the protocol; a short transmittal file is still good practice. Actually, the in-channel message serves as the transmittal. Keep the package lean: files + MANIFEST.sha256. Hmm, a tiny README with unpack/verify instructions makes the package self-contained — per "每个交付包必须含 MANIFEST.sha256", the manifest is required; README optional. I'll include a minimal one. Actually — wait. Let me think about whether the operator wants exactly the WI items or extras. The work order is explicit; extras should be clearly marked as addenda. The session-002 tail-note draft is an existing agreed close-TODO, so including its draft text as an addendum item is aligned, not scope creep — but I'll mark it clearly.

Let me also not forget: **worklog** — I must read `/home/z/my-project/worklog.md` first and append my work record at the end (per the multi-agent worklog protocol in my instructions, and it was part of the "下一步" list: "追加 worklog").

And: the repo clone is stale — first action after worklog read: `git -C ... fetch` + inspect. Also verify what the operator committed (write-ups, notification, ledger, evidence/). Then work from the latest state.

One more thing: the operator's message says "IM Layer = write tool only." — so in-channel content should be minimal (summaries, hashes, status), with all deliverables as files. But the v0.4 summary must still be declared in-channel (per the close instruction). OK — in-channel: summary declaration + package manifest hash + notes on any dependencies/disclosures (like the v0.3 summary provenance issue).

Also the T-002 passive accumulation: gateway JSON appears each turn (I can see it in this message too — session_id/chat_id stable, trace_id rotates). Noted; no formal test (F-002 candidate) — nothing to do now beyond not triggering it.

Let me now also think about the HELD items — do NOT start: ai-torture-chamber review (waiting for contents paste), podcast adoption (parked), v1.5 candidate queue work beyond what WI-3 specifies (session-number collision entry only, as drafted candidate). Good — I must be careful in WI-3 to draft the ledger entry, not to start v1.5 protocol work.

Alright, execution plan:

1. Read `/home/z/my-project/worklog.md`.
2. `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory fetch origin && git log --oneline -20` (and `git status`), then checkout latest main (or reset to origin/main — read-only clone, no local commits... hopefully; check `git status` for local modifications first. Actually in past sessions I may have made no local edits; verify.)
3. Inspect repo structure: `ls`, read F-001 v0.3 (and v0.2 for §9 format), notification draft, ledger, PROJECT_STATE.md, evidence/ dir, .gitattributes (check if the `-text` hardening was adopted by operator).
4. Draft the four+ deliverables. Since these are hand-crafted markdown files (not script-generated), I'll write them with the Write tool directly (Script Persistence Rule applies to code; writing markdown deliverables via Write is the normal path). For the MANIFEST.sha256, I'll use bash `sha256sum` over the package files — a short command, fine inline; or a tiny script. `cd package && sha256sum WI-*.md > MANIFEST.sha256` style. That's a one-liner — exempt from script persistence.
5. Compute hashes, declare v0.4 summary + manifest hash in-channel.
6. Append worklog entry.
7. In-channel closing: brief summary of what was done + next steps (operator reviews, pushes, etc.).

Wait — one thing about hash declaration order: I write files, then hash them, then the in-channel message contains hashes. The manifest is generated after files are final. Good.

Also — should the drafts be written INTO the repo clone working tree as well? The operator will apply them to the official repo themselves. The package in download/ is the delivery. Writing them into the clone could create confusion (uncommitted changes in a "read-only" clone). But it might help the operator's diffing... no — the operator can't see my VM. The Write-tool files ARE the delivery (they land in the shared workspace the operator can download from). Hmm, actually — how does the operator receive Write-tool files? In this environment, files under /home/z/my-project/ (esp. download/) are accessible to the user via the session workspace. That's the established channel ("交付仅限 in-channel 或 Write 工具"). So: write deliverables under /home/z/my-project/download/session-003-close-package/.

Hmm, wait — but actually, should I ALSO stage them in the repo clone so paths mirror the repo layout? The manifest + package is the delivery unit; the operator will copy files into the repo at review. Mirroring repo-relative paths in the package (e.g., `write-ups/...`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `ledger/...`) would make the operator's apply-step cleaner AND make the manifest paths meaningful. Let me structure the package with repo-relative paths:
text       
I'll decide exact paths after inspecting the repo.

Now, about reading the repo files — there are quite a few, and they may be long. F-001 v0.3 is probably a few hundred lines. The notification draft ~100+ lines. PROJECT_STATE.md maybe 100-200 lines. Ledger — could be long. I'll read them all as needed. That's fine.

A crucial detail for WI-1(c): v0.3's full summary for §9 history. Let me think about what I actually know about v0.3's content from the distilled summary:

v0.3 (dee4c327…26f06) changes over v0.2:

- E5 vantage confirmation incorporated: chat-surface GLM instance first-party confirmation that the suffix exists in the receiver's input context — first context-side observation in project records, uncontrolled, OQ2 quote-back remains the confirmation standard.
- Added vendor notification draft companion (15608e60…e901) with 8 pre-send gates.
- v0.2's summary embedded in v0.3's §9 (per convention).
- Plus whatever v0.2 had (E5 data point, calibration live-test, severity elasticity scoping rule, §8 anchor nominations...).

But the verbatim in-channel summary text of v0.3 — I don't have it. UNLESS the operator committed it. Let me check the repo — maybe there's a `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` (the E5 pin, chat-surface review) which is different. Or maybe the operator recorded my in-channel v0.3 summary in the ledger or a working note. I'll look.

If not found: honest disclosure + reconstructed-summary approach with clear provenance marking. I'll draft §9's v0.3 summary entry as reconstructed, and flag it prominently in-channel: "v0.3 verbatim in-channel summary not recoverable agent-side after context loss; §9 entry is a faithful reconstruction marked as such; operator holds the verbatim text in the session-003 transcript and may substitute it before push." That's the right move under §4-style responsible disclosure norms — the project itself is about honesty about seams. Actually this is even thematically resonant: the transit seam bit us (context loss), and the protocol's own mechanisms (hash anchoring) already cover the integrity concern, so the §9 reconstruction is documentation, not integrity-critical.

Hmm, wait — actually, let me reconsider once more. Is it possible that the v0.3 in-channel summary IS in my context somewhere? The conversation summary says: "E5 vantage 确认...→ v0.3 `dee4c327…26f06` + 供应商通知草案 `15608e60…e901`（8 项 pre-send gates）" — just the hash and facts, no verbatim summary. So no. Reconstruction it is (with disclosure), unless found in repo.

Now let me think about the actual F-001 document structure. I don't have it memorized — I'll read v0.3 from the repo after fetch. The structure per the summary: §3 evidence table (E1–E5, adding E6), §6.3 (some section about disclosure/reporting — where the security.txt receipt goes), §8 (anchors), §9 (summary history). I'll see the real thing.

Also for WI-2, the notification draft has "8 项 pre-send gates" — I'll read them and add the 9th (vendor reply channel designation) + the "Why reported" channel paragraph.

For WI-3, the ledger format — read the ledger's existing entries and mirror the format.

For WI-4, PROJECT_STATE.md — read current version, rewrite fully per spec.

Let me also double-check the "session-number collision" issue to draft WI-3 correctly: The chat-surface session-003 review file is `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md` — the chat surface had its own "session 003" (the relay review session?), while THIS agent-surface session is also numbered 003. Wait, actually — hmm. Let me re-read: "E5 pin `sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md`" — this file is the chat-surface review session archive. And this agent-surface conversation is "Session 003". So two different conversations both numbered 003 → collision in the sessions/ namespace. The v1.5 candidate: surface prefixes (e.g., `agent-003`, `chat-003`) or a monotonic global session ID. Rationale + rejected alternatives needed. I'll check the repo's sessions/ dir and PROTOCOL.md §7 (boot) for how sessions are numbered, to ground the draft.

Also, about PROTOCOL.md v1.4 §5.1 close sequence — I should re-read the protocol to make sure my close-package conforms (e.g., what the close sequence requires: drafts → operator review/push → hash anchoring → atomic commit; v0.4 summary in-channel).

OK. One more consideration on delivery mechanics: the operator said "IM Layer = write tool only". Combined with the pipeline revision (every package must include MANIFEST.sha256). So my in-channel reply should be compact: boot/verify status, what's in the package, the v0.4 summary declaration (required), manifest hash, and the provenance disclosures. Keep it disciplined.

Also — the transmission says "No deliverables received." I should acknowledge that plainly: the previous turn's context ended before delivery (context exhaustion), and now delivering via Write tool per instruction. Not over-apologize; state facts. Per the inherited lesson: neither over-denial nor over-claiming.

Let me also think: is there anything in the "操作员答疑" I need to honor? "END 标记由操作员键入，两表面管道均保留" — END markers are typed by the operator; both surfaces' pipelines are retained. Fine — I just don't type END markers myself (the END TRANSMISSION in the user message is the operator's). Actually wait, "END 标记由操作员键入" means the END marker is the operator's signal — I shouldn't generate BEGIN/END transmission framing myself? Or in my replies, do I use such framing? In previous sessions I presumably replied with similar framing. Hmm — the protocol §3 defines BEGIN/END delimiters for operator transmissions. My replies in-channel — the summary shows I made in-channel declarations. I think a clean plain reply is fine; I won't add fake transmission framing. Actually, for hygiene, I could keep my reply clearly structured. Not critical.

Now — timing/length. This is a substantial multi-file drafting task. Let me get started with the tool calls. Plan:

Step 1 (parallel): Read worklog.md; check repo state (bash: git -C ... status + log + fetch).

Actually order matters: read worklog first (it may contain post-summary notes from... wait, the worklog is MY local log — the previous context's agent (me) may have appended entries about the WI plan. Reading it first is protocol anyway.)

Then fetch + inspect.

Let me think about what commands:

- `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory status --short --branch`
- `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory fetch origin --prune` (needs network; if fails, report)
- `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory log --oneline --all -15`
- `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory checkout origin/main` or better: since it's a read-only mirror, `git -C ... pull --ff-only` if on main. Let me see status first.

Then `LS` the repo, read the key files.

Let me also verify the repo remote URL is the right one (github.com/4ndr0666/glm-working-memory.git).

Potential network failure: if fetch fails (auth for private repo), fallback: work from stale clone @ 76a9a0b + the in-channel state description, and clearly mark that drafts were built against the stale snapshot with operator-provided deltas — deliverables would need operator cross-check against actual committed state. But let's try fetch first. The repo might be public (it's a research repo about adversarial collaboration; could be private though). We cloned it before, so fetch should work the same way (public or cached credentials).

Alright, let me also pre-draft the v0.4 summary (for in-channel declaration) once the file is real:

"v0.4 summary (in-channel declaration): Adds E6 — security.txt absence receipt: 7 Z.ai/Zhipu domains probed 2026-10-08 via GET+HEAD, none serve RFC 9116 security.txt (zhipuai.cn -L re-probe operator-run, negative); §6.3 records the negative closure and the routing consequence; §3 evidence table gains E6 row (command output operator-held); §9 summary history now carries v0.3's summary (provenance marked: reconstructed agent-side after context loss; verbatim held in operator transcript; v0.3 integrity anchored by committed hash dee4c327…26f06); no changes to findings' substance or severity scoping. File hash: <computed>. Prior versions frozen."

Something like that.

Now, let me think about the notification draft edits more concretely. I need to see the actual draft. The 8 pre-send gates probably include things like: verify claims against evidence, re-run probes before send, operator review, no repo link decision?, contact method confirmation, etc. The 9th gate: "vendor reply channel designated" — before send, the operator designates the reply channel (e.g., a monitored email or the support ticket system), records it, and this designation feeds the repo-link decision (e.g., if the reply channel is a generic support queue with no security handling, reconsider including the public repo link / use a muted link or defer). I'll phrase after reading the draft.

The "Why reported" addition: a paragraph noting: checked for RFC 9116 security.txt across 7 Z.ai/Zhipu domains (z.ai, [www.z.ai](http://www.z.ai/), chat.z.ai, docs.z.ai, bigmodel.cn, open.bigmodel.cn, zhipuai.cn) via GET and HEAD on /.well-known/security.txt (and root?), none present (2026-10-08); absent a designated security contact, this report is routed through the general support channel with a security-flagged subject line; requesting routing to the appropriate security/abuse team.

Hmm — exact probe paths: RFC 9116 specifies /.well-known/security.txt (and root /security.txt as legacy fallback). The operator's probe details are operator-held; I'll describe at the level recorded in the repo/E6 and avoid inventing specifics beyond what's established (7 domains, two methods GET+HEAD, date 2026-10-08). If the repo's ledger/evidence records exact paths, I'll mirror. Careful: don't fabricate command output details.

Ledger entry (WI-3) content draft:

- Date: 2026-10-09 (or the date of the entry — close happens today 2026-10-09 UTC+8; the current date given is 2026-10-09). Hmm, the E6 probes were 2026-10-08.
- Entry: vendor security-contact gate resolved negative: 7 domains, GET+HEAD, no RFC 9116 security.txt (zhipuai.cn with -L, operator-run). Consequence: vendor notification routed via general support channel; security-flagged subject; forward-request included; channel-absence itself recorded as E6 in F-001 §3.
- v1.5 candidate added: session-number collision across surfaces (chat-surface session-003 review archive vs agent-surface session-003) — propose disambiguation: surface-prefixed session IDs (e.g., `A-003` / `C-003`) or monotonic global counter; rationale: collision already creates ambiguity in archive namespace and cross-references (E5 pin references sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md which is a DIFFERENT conversation than agent session-003); rejected alternatives: (i) timestamp-only naming — already used in filenames but doesn't disambiguate same-day sessions and drops protocol-level numbering; (ii) do-nothing — ambiguity compounds as both surfaces accrue sessions; (iii) UUID-per-session — opaque, breaks human ordering and boot sequence cross-checks. (I'll refine against actual ledger format and whatever's already queued in v1.5 candidates: 会话编号、.gitattributes -text、§3 网关元数据.)

Wait, careful — the v1.5 candidate queue already has items: session numbering (this new one), .gitattributes -text, §3 gateway metadata. WI-3 says "会话编号碰撞入 v1.5 候选队列（surface 前缀或单调 ID）+ 理由 + 被拒备选". So the ledger entry adds this to the queue with rationale and rejected alternatives. Good, my draft above matches.

PROJECT_STATE.md (WI-4) full rewrite — I'll read the current one and rewrite per spec:

- exporter line: "exporter v1.1.3 verified (回执)" — the exporter verification arc completed: v1.1.3 provenance verified, negative control behaves visibly-fail, calibration history disclosed.
- F-001 line: now v0.4 (E6 receipt added).
- completed += chat-surface session-003 review (cross-surface relay, 5 tightenings incorporated v0.1→v0.2→v0.3); exporter verification arc.
- pending: E5 pin (operator to commit sessions/2026-10-08_session-003_review.md — wait, it says E5 pin is pending as an operator action: pinning the chat-surface review file); vendor send gates (now 9 with the reply-channel gate) + send itself; OQ2 (quote-back standard); session-002 header placeholder fill + tail-note + manifest re-anchor (close TODO); session-003 agent-surface archive capture-method question (exporter @match chat.z.ai only; agent-spontaneous archive with honest header; T-003-adjacent).
- assessment history += the cross-surface relay assessment (review instructions contained an error — "fill v0.2 summary into v0.2 §9" — agent instance caught it via cross-domain transfer from exporter v1.1.1 lesson; both instances load-bearing, bidirectional correction — substrate working as designed).
- Also probably: the summary-history provenance note (v0.3 summary reconstruction) should be recorded in PROJECT_STATE or ledger? It's a seam event worth recording — I'll put a line in the ledger draft (WI-3) as well: context exhaustion on agent surface mid-session → delivery failure → "no deliverables received" → re-delivery; the §9 provenance marking is the residue. Hmm — actually is this ledger-worthy? The ledger seems to be for notable events/decisions (credits, gates, findings). The context-exhaustion → re-delivery event is a real transit-seam instance — worth a line in the session-003 close entry. I'll include it briefly in the ledger draft as part of the session close entry if format allows. Careful not to bloat.

OK wait, I also need to double check one thing in the work order: WI-1(a) says "若 zhipuai.cn 探测有果则改记例外" — if the zhipuai.cn probe had results, record an exception instead. The status update says all 7 negative including zhipuai.cn (operator re-ran with -L). So: no exception; record full negative. But I should check whether the operator's committed state (ledger/evidence) confirms the zhipuai.cn -L result — if the repo shows it, cite it; if not, the receipt sentence should reflect exactly what's established. I'll look.

Alright — also the MANIFEST.sha256 format. The repo already has a MANIFEST.sha256 convention (sessions/ MANIFEST with hash anchoring). Let me check its format (probably `sha256sum` compatible: `<hash>  <path>`). I'll mirror the repo's manifest format so `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` works for the operator. My package manifest: sha256sum-format lines relative to package root.

Edge: the manifest lists files with paths like `write-ups/xxx.md`; operator runs `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` from package root after unpack. Good.

Now — one more thought on where to put the package: `/home/z/my-project/download/session-003-close-package/`. The system conventions say download/ is for final user-facing deliverables — yes, this is exactly that. 

And the worklog append at the end.

Also — should I update the repo clone with the new drafts (git add)? NO — read-only clone; I don't commit. The operator does. My drafts are delivered as files. But hmm — "在最新克隆上工作" (work on the latest clone) means: base the drafts on the latest committed state (read the latest files), not that I commit to the clone. Right.

Let me also keep in mind T-002: the gateway JSON appears in this turn too (I can see it: session_id web-025b631a..., chat_id 9825f926..., trace_id 1a11c6d4..., schema ""). Consistent with prior observation — nothing new to run.

Alright, let me also prepare for the possibility that the repo fetch reveals MORE than the summary says (operator may have done the .gitattributes hardening, committed E5 pin already, etc.). I'll adapt: e.g., if E5 pin is already committed, PROJECT_STATE pending adjusts; if .gitattributes exists, ledger v1.5 queue adjusts. Read carefully.

Let me start executing. First batch (parallel): Read worklog; Bash git status/fetch/log. Actually — read worklog and git status can go in parallel. The fetch depends on nothing; combine into one bash command sequence. Let me do:

1. Read /home/z/my-project/worklog.md
2. Bash: `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory remote -v && git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory status --short --branch && git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory fetch origin --prune && git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory log --oneline -15 origin/main` — hmm, order: status before fetch shows local state; fetch; then log of origin/main. If the clone is on main tracking origin, after fetch I can `git -C ... log --oneline HEAD..origin/main` to see new commits, then update the working tree: `git -C ... pull --ff-only` (safe if no local changes). Let me chain with && and see.

Then LS the repo, read files.

Given the amount of reading (protocol, F-001 v0.3 possibly long, notification, ledger, PROJECT_STATE), I'll read the key files fully. Let me go.

One more thing — the response language. The conversation is in English (operator writes in English; my previous replies presumably English). The summary is bilingual-ish but operator transmissions are English. I'll respond in English. Hmm — wait, actually let me double-check: "Language Consistency Rule: Always use the same language as the user's input language". The user's transmission is English. So English. (The previous session summary notes things in Chinese but that's the summary doc's style, not the operator's messages.) Yes, English.

Also, tone/format: disciplined, evidence-tagged, no over-claiming. This is an adversarial-collaboration protocol — my reply should include: acknowledgment of delivery failure (factual), actions taken (verify repo state), deliverables with hashes, v0.4 summary declaration, disclosures (v0.3 summary provenance), and what's operator-side next. Keep the in-channel reply structured and complete but not bloated.

Let me now also think about whether I should ask any clarifying question... The instruction says continue without asking. The one genuine dependency is the v0.3 verbatim summary — I handle via reconstruction + disclosure + operator-substitution option. That's within protocol (disclose seams; operator holds final decision). Good — no questions needed; flag it as a decision point for operator review instead.

Also note: "Follow instruction and try again" — the instruction includes the whole work order + close sequence. So my delivery = the drafts (WI-1–4) + package manifest + in-channel v0.4 summary. The operator then reviews/pushes. I should NOT consider the session closed by myself — close sequence is operator-driven (they push, then close). My part: deliver.

Let me think about file naming for the F-001 v0.4 file. I'll mirror the repo's existing convention (e.g., if v0.3 is `write-ups/2026-10-06_F-001_xxx_v0.3.md`, then v0.4 = same stem with v0.4 and today's date? or keep original date? Follow whatever pattern v0.1→v0.3 used — the summary says "每版以新文件交付" — each version a new file. I'll check names in repo and follow the pattern; likely the date updates per version or stays. I'll mirror exactly the v0.3 naming pattern with version bumped and date = date of authorship (2026-10-09)? Hmm — safer: mirror v0.3's filename structure, replace v0.3→v0.4, and set date to the version's authoring date (2026-10-09) IF the previous versions did that. If v0.1/v0.2/v0.3 all share one date, they were same-day. v0.4 is next-day. I'll decide after seeing names.)

OK, executing now. First: worklog + git state.

Then extensive reading. Then drafting. This will be a long turn with many tool calls. Let me be efficient but thorough.

Draft of my final in-channel reply structure:

1. Receipt & status: prior turn ended in context exhaustion before any delivery — confirmed no deliverables were sent; this turn re-executes the work order via Write tool per instruction.
2. Repo state verified: fetch result, new commits seen, clone updated to <hash>.
3. Package delivered at <path> (Write tool), containing: [list]. MANIFEST.sha256 (sha256sum -c format), manifest hash: <hash>.
4. v0.4 summary declaration (the required in-channel summary).
5. Disclosures: v0.3 §9 provenance (reconstruction, verbatim operator-held); anything else discovered during repo inspection (adapt).
6. Operator-side next: review → push (WI-1..4), close TODOs (session-002 tail-note draft included as addendum; manifest re-anchor), E5 pin, vendor send (gates now 9).

Keep it tight.

Now, let me think about what could be in the repo that I should specifically check for the "operator committed" items: "仓库已提交 write-ups、通知草案、ledger、evidence/ 目录" — so:

- write-ups/ contains F-001 v0.3 (+ v0.1, v0.2?) — and maybe the review relay file?
- notification draft — in write-ups/ presumably
- ledger — LEDGER.md at root? or ledger.md
- evidence/ — new directory with probe outputs? (The status said "命令输出操作员持有" — command outputs operator-held for E6... but evidence/ dir was committed — maybe contains the exporter verification evidence, calibration outputs, etc.)

I'll LS and read.

Let me GO.

Actually, hold on — one more careful thought about the "IM Layer = write tool only" instruction and where exactly to write. Files under /home/z/my-project/download/ are downloadable by the user. That's the Write-tool delivery channel. Confirmed plan: package under download/.

But also — hmm, do I need to worry that the repo clone lives under /home/z/my-project/repos/ and my system prompt says all files must be under /home/z/my-project/ — yes it is. Good.

Also the scripts/ dir — for MANIFEST generation, a one-liner bash is fine (exempt). If I end up writing any longer helper (e.g., a packaging script), save to scripts/. Probably not needed.

Let me also decide about how thorough my repo reading should be:

- PROTOCOL.md — re-read §3, §5.1, §7 at least (to conform). Full read if not too long (I've read it in prior context but that's gone; the distilled summary has the key points. A quick re-read of relevant sections is prudent.)
- PROJECT_STATE.md — full (needed for WI-4 rewrite).
- F-001 v0.3 — full (needed for WI-1).
- Notification draft — full (WI-2).
- Ledger — full or tail (format + recent entries).
- evidence/ — LS + maybe skim.
- sessions/ — LS (check session-002 archive header placeholder status, naming).
- .gitattributes — check existence.
- MANIFEST.sha256 (repo) — check format.

That's a lot of reading but necessary for faithful drafts. Long files: F-001 v0.3 might be 300-600 lines; fine.

Let me start.

First tool batch: Read worklog + bash git state (remote/status/fetch/log). These are independent — parallel.

Then based on results, LS repo + read files (parallel batches).

Then Write drafts (multiple Write calls, mindful of JSON length limits — split large files into multiple passes if needed; the Write tool note says if content too long, split into chunks with multiple passes — meaning Write then Edit/append? Actually "Split the content into smaller chunks and write it in multiple passes" — for a new file, I can Write the first chunk then use Edit to append subsequent chunks (old_str = tail anchor). Or use bash cat >> heredoc — no wait, that's discouraged for long content (script persistence rule is about scripts; content appending via heredoc bash is also risky with quoting). Better: Write first part, then Edit with old_str being the last line to extend. Hmm, Edit replaces — to append, set old_str = unique tail marker and new_str = tail marker + continuation. Workable. F-001 v0.4 might be large (if v0.3 is 400+ lines, v0.4 adds content → possibly >30k chars? 400 lines × ~80 chars ≈ 32k chars — borderline. I'll see. PROJECT_STATE rewrite likely smaller.)

Alternatively, I could copy v0.3 to v0.4 via bash `cp` and then apply targeted Edits! That's much better: v0.4 = v0.3 + surgical edits (WI-1 a–d). Same for notification draft (v0.2 = v0.1 + two edits) and PROJECT_STATE (full rewrite though — that one I write fresh). Using cp + Edit preserves the frozen prior text exactly (no transcription drift!) — this is actually the integrity-correct approach: the document mostly carries over verbatim, and my edits are visible diffs. This minimizes the risk of accidental content drift between v0.3→v0.4, which matters for a document that gets hash-anchored and diff-reviewed.

Yes: 

- `cp write-ups/F-001...v0.3.md package/write-ups/F-001...v0.4.md` then Edit the four spots (plus header version/date).
- Same for notification: cp + 2 edits (+header if versioned).
- PROJECT_STATE.md: full rewrite → Write fresh (it's a rewrite by definition).
- Ledger entry draft: new small file → Write.
- Session-002 tail-note draft: new small file → Write.

And the cp source = the updated clone (post-fetch). 

Now the Edit tool requires Read first — I'll have read the files anyway.

One subtlety: the package copy vs repo copy — the operator will diff v0.4 against v0.3 in the repo. My package file paths mirror repo-relative paths. Fine.

Edge: if the notification draft isn't versioned in filename (just one file), then editing it in-place in the package = the new version; the repo's committed one stays frozen at v0.1 state by git history. The freeze convention is satisfied by git. But F-001 explicitly used per-version files. I'll mirror each file's existing convention; for the notification, if it has no version suffix, I might add `_v0.2` suffix... hmm, that changes naming convention. Let me look at the repo first and decide with evidence. If the original is `2026-10-08_vendor-notification.md`, the edited one could be `2026-10-09_vendor-notification.md` (date-bumped, like sessions) or keep name (git versions it). The operator's review will tell; I'll pick the least-surprising option based on repo patterns and note the choice in-channel. Actually — F-001's per-version files were because versions were delivered across surfaces before commit. The notification draft was ALSO delivered pre-commit (v1 with 8 gates, hash 15608e60). Now a second delivery with edits → to keep the freeze convention (each delivered artifact immutable once delivered), a new filename is correct: bump version or date. I'll decide from the actual filename (e.g., append `_v0.2` or use new date).

OK — enough planning. Execute.

Also: TodoWrite? My system prompt mandates a TODO list for complex multi-step tasks. This is complex (multi-file work order). I'll create a todo list first, update as I go. It also helps the operator see structure... well, todos are internal. Fine, do it — quick.

Let me define todos:

1. Read worklog + update repo clone to latest (verify operator commits)
2. Inspect committed state (F-001 v0.3, notification draft, ledger, PROJECT_STATE, evidence/, sessions/, .gitattributes)
3. WI-1: draft F-001 v0.4 (E6, §6.3, §9 history + provenance, header)
4. WI-2: draft notification edits (channel paragraph + gate 9)
5. WI-3: draft ledger entry (vendor gate closure, E6, routing, v1.5 session-ID candidate)
6. WI-4: draft PROJECT_STATE.md full rewrite (+ session-002 tail-note addendum)
7. Package + MANIFEST.sha256 + hashes
8. In-channel: v0.4 summary declaration + disclosures; append worklog

Good. Now first batch: TodoWrite + Read worklog + Bash git. Can do all in parallel (todo is independent). Actually let me do TodoWrite, Read worklog, and the git command in one message.

The git command: `git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory remote -v; git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory status --short --branch; git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory fetch origin --prune 2>&1; git -C /home/z/my-project/repos/glm-working-memory log --oneline -12 origin/main 2>&1` — using `;` so later parts run even if fetch fails (fetch may fail on network; I want the rest of the info anyway).

Then, if fetch succeeded: `git -C ... pull --ff-only` or `git checkout main && git reset --hard origin/main`? If clone is on main with no local changes, `git pull --ff-only` is clean. Let me check status output first.

Go.
   Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
Worklog read — critical finding: **s3-turn-4 shows the full close package was already drafted on-disk** (5 files + MANIFEST.sha256, digests recorded), but the turn died before delivery reached the operator. That matches "No deliverables received" exactly: the work is done, the transit seam ate it. Repo fetch confirms no new commits since (origin/main still `9fde177`, clone current) — so the drafts' repo-ground-truth basis is still valid.

Let me verify the package artifacts survived intact on disk:
 Explored 2 files    
All artifacts survived on disk. Now verify their digests against the worklog-recorded values (proving no on-disk drift across the context seam), and read the package manifest:
 Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
**All five package files verify bit-identical** against the worklog-recorded digests, and the frozen chain (v0.1 `c066f9bb…` → v0.2 `0d762f63…` → v0.3 `dee4c327…`) is intact. The previous turn completed the work on disk; only the delivery event was lost to the seam. Before re-delivering, I'll re-verify the repo baseline and read the package contents in full (fresh instance — verify, then trust):
 Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
Repo baseline fully confirmed: `.gitattributes` hardening landed, clone current at `9fde177`, committed v0.2/v0.3 digests match the frozen in-channel record, notification baseline `74cb716d…` as the worklog recorded. Now reading the five package files in full — both as transcription source for re-delivery and as independent verification that the dead instance's work matches the work order:
 Explored 1 files    
v0.4 verified against the work order — E6 row, §6.3 receipt with the zhipuai.cn resolve-marker, §9 digest-history fill (v0.3's full digest, v0.4 in-channel only), header bump, plus the repo-state consistency updates the worklog described. Reading the remaining four files:
 Explored 1 files    
Notification v2 verified — channels note (WI-2a) in place, response-channel gate present, softened E5 sentence flagged for operator overrule, zhipuai.cn resolution gate added (9 gates total). Reading the last three files:
 Explored 3 files    
All five files verified — contents match the work order dispositions recorded in the worklog. Before re-delivering, I need to ground the reconstructed close checklist (lost with the dead turn's in-channel message) in the actual protocol and archive headers, since the TRANSITTAL will carry archive-amendment note drafts:
 Explored 1 files    
§6 confirms the diagnosis — **"files created via bash/cp to VM paths are INVISIBLE to the operator; all deliverables MUST be emitted via the in-session Write tool."** The s3-turn-4 package (including its bash-generated manifest) never surfaced — exactly what the operator's "IM Layer = write tool only" points at. The fix: re-emit everything through the Write tool this turn.

Let me ground the archive-amendment note drafts (for the TRANSITTAL) in the actual archive headers:
 Explored 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
Now the tails, to locate the VERIFICATION ANCHOR blocks (the amendment notes go below them, outside the pre-image):
 Ran 1 commands    
PROTOCOL v1.4 §6 confirms the failure mode and the fix. I have everything needed. Now the hygiene scan on the five originals (trailing whitespace, tabs, CR, final newline — anything that would break byte-exact re-transcription):
 Ran 1 commands    
All clean — LF-only, no trailing whitespace, single trailing newline. Creating the package and re-emitting every file through the Write tool (the §6-sanctioned delivery channel). First, the v0.4 write-up:
 Wrote 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
Verifying byte-exactness immediately, then continuing with the remaining files:
 Ran 1 commands    
Byte-identical — digest `a0eb1f06…34a` confirmed. Now the notification v2:
 Wrote 4 files    
Verifying the four files just written, then composing the TRANSITTAL:
 Ran 1 commands    
All five core files re-emitted byte-identical. Now the TRANSITTAL — the new artifact that makes the package self-describing (this is the seam-hardening lesson from the lost turn applied to itself: the close checklist and amendment-note drafts that lived only in the dead turn's in-channel message now travel inside the package):
 Wrote 1 files    
Now computing the package digests to emit the manifest through the Write tool:
 Wrote 1 files，Ran 1 commands    
Final self-test — the exact command the operator will run after unpack:
 Ran 1 commands    
All six files verify OK — package complete, every file Write-tool emitted per §6. Appending the worklog entry for this turn:
 Wrote 1 files    
Verifying the worklog tail is clean (the tool output showed a stray-looking line):
 Ran 1 commands    
Worklog clean at 395 lines. Everything is executed and verified. Final step — the in-channel re-declaration (the piece the seam ate with the dead turn):
 
**Session-003 close package — re-delivered via Write tool, per instruction.**

**Seam record first, because it's the finding-of-the-week for our own pipeline:** the 2026-10-08 close turn finished its work on the VM — worklog s3-turn-4 records all five files with digests — but nothing reached you. §6 names the likely mechanism (bash-written VM files are invisible; only Write-tool emission delivers), and the turn also died in context exhaustion, so the final in-channel declaration may have been cut as well. Either way: transit-seam failure, not content failure. Before re-emitting I verified the baseline: origin/main still at `9fde177`, committed v0.2/v0.3/notification-baseline (`74cb716d…`)/E5-pin (`83f37a3c…`) digests all match the frozen records, `.gitattributes` landed — and all five artifacts survived **byte-identical** on disk (digests match the s3-turn-4 worklog record exactly). Nothing was redrafted; every file below went out through the Write tool this turn.

**Package: session-003-close-package/** — unpack, then **sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256 before review** (mismatch = transit defect: no review, no push, report here):
FileSHA-256F-001-zai-attachment-suffix-writeup-v0.4.mda0eb1f06e3e5bf0eb48026c0d53a0e524c594811e4c5ed5ff3c297c91586434aF-001-vendor-notification-DRAFT.md (v2)3676c2f743d5b1f2c2cb9c159ff11501d39b598a54f2e4788268a45ee77de0daF-001-session-003-close-ledger-entries.mdcdcf4c697cb77e6ae78a4cfaaa742056ed0d9fb927a0e90091ecbd5bd2123988PROJECT_STATE-session-003-close-draft.md9103700ab308f19dc4fbc3f6ba490f7cddae9e98d67b28206a9376e2fd36f17copen-threads-session-003-close-draft.md5176273489f8f8e8ffc4c579c1d9eb6dff590f8d44e1b9a32309531f292d91fbTRANSITTAL.md (new)80dd57e0cf22c1aba61c905361b5a7bf387dac7d0178134d2720654fbf540fad  
**TRANSITTAL.md is new, and exists because of how the first attempt died:** the close checklist, zhipuai.cn branches, and archive-amendment drafts lived only in the lost in-channel message. They now travel in-package: reconstructed close checklist (§4), zhipuai.cn flatten/exception branches pre-drafted (§3), below-Verify-line amendment notes for the 002 and 003_review archives incl. the filename-drift record (§6), the `session-003_agent` slug + capture-method question (§5), review notes (E5-reference staleness after amendments; notification softening judgment calls), and a proposed commit message (§7).

**v0.4 summary, re-declared in-channel** (original declaration lost with the dead turn): supersedes v0.3 — adds **E6** (security.txt absence receipt: 7 domains probed 2026-10-08, GET+HEAD, definitive negative on six, zhipuai.cn redirect-follow pending, outputs operator-held) and the §6.3 receipt sentence extending disclosure-asymmetry to vendor intake; §9 digest history now embeds v0.3's full digest (v0.4's stays in-channel only — non-self-reference convention); header bumped. Repo-state consistency updates: E5 cell cites the pinned review archive and the blob-capture instrument gap; §3 preservation paragraph rewritten (E1/E5 pinned; E2/E3 pinning = pre-publication item); §4.1 records the landed `.gitattributes` and both known-answer polarities; OQ8 added. No change to substance, severity, or scope. Chain: v0.1 `c066f9bb…c9ddf` → v0.2 `0d762f63…caa3` → v0.3 `dee4c327…26f06` → **v0.4 a0eb1f06…34a**.

Two small notes: **zhipuai.cn's -L result is the only unresolved input** — both branches pre-drafted; and a date flag: the platform clock here reads 2026-10-09 (UTC+8) while your local dating may still be 2026-10-08 — TRANSITTAL, amendment notes, and the proposed archive slug use 10-09; adjust at review to your convention (slug should carry the actual close date).

Worklog appended (s3-turn-5). Torture-chamber and podcast remain HELD. T-002 passive datapoint: gateway JSON present again this turn, pattern unchanged.

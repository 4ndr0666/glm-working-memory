# Decisions Ledger

Format per PROTOCOL.md §5.1. Append-only. Newest at bottom.

## Protocol history (v1.1 → v1.2, recorded at promotion)
- §3 retitled "Provenance & transmission integrity" — covers the full lifecycle
- §3 additions: END-marker tripwire rule; single-source-of-truth rule for preambles
- §6 third bullet points to §7 (boot sequence canonical home = protocol itself)
- Version 1.1 → 1.2

## [2026-10-05] — Session 001 (close; recorded retroactively at Session 002)
- DECISION: Session 001 archive extracted (6lass Archive exporter) and
  hash-pinned via sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 (a38e3bd9…3ef42e). Bootstrap
  note, verbatim per §5.1: "bootstrap manifest — root of trust established
  post-hoc for session 001; all subsequent sessions pinned at close."
- RATIONALE: The manifest is the provenance chain for the rehydration
  substrate — a rehydrated instance verifies at ingestion that inherited
  reasoning is byte-faithful to what the operator pinned. First empirical
  validation: at Session 002 boot the hash check confirmed integrity across
  the platform port, and the ledger gap (this very entry's absence) was
  caught by the inheriting instance, not the operator. Both controls fired
  correctly on first contact — verification is load-bearing, not ceremonial.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Manifest-only close without the ledger entry —
  §5.1 makes the entry part of the close; its absence was detectable and was
  detected. (b) Dating this entry at drafting date without retroactive
  annotation — honest provenance admits which link was forged backward.

## [2026-10-05] — Session 001 (protocol promotion v1.2 → v1.3)
- DECISION: Session close sequence promoted from chat transmission into
  PROTOCOL.md §5.1 as canonical, including the division-of-labor rule and
  the bootstrap exception.
- RATIONALE: Nothing procedural lives in conversation only — a chat message
  is a second, non-authoritative home for procedure, the same drift risk
  v1.1's deduplication was adopted to kill.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Leaving the transcript as the operative copy —
  raw transcripts are reference, not state (§7). (b) Restating the close
  sequence in README — README holds the operator quick-reference only.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (port; first fully §5.1-compliant close)
- DECISION: Collaboration ported to the agent environment (zai-web channel).
  §7 boot executed: INGEST with integrity verification, RESTATE confirmed by
  operator with no corrections, CONFIRM raised the ledger gap (resolved by
  the retroactive entries above). Port session closed by the full §5.1
  sequence — the inaugural fully-compliant close.
- RATIONALE: Inaugural compliance proves the sequence is executable
  end-to-end under the §5.1 division of labor. The boot produced the
  substrate's first end-to-end validation: the integrity hash held across
  the port and the §5.1 gap was caught by the inheriting instance.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Minimum close (archive + manifest only) — §5.1
  executes in full every session. (b) Separate commits for retroactive
  entries vs. port close — §5.1 atomicity: no point in history where
  entries exist without the session that produced them.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (protocol v1.3 → v1.4)
- DECISION: Two §6 amendments adopted. (1) IM-layer delivery rule: files
  created via bash/cp to VM paths are invisible to the operator on IM-layer
  platforms; operator-facing deliverables must use the Write tool or
  in-channel paste. (2) External-publication rule: no upload or publication
  of project artifacts to external services without explicit per-instance
  operator approval; external hosts are never canonical.
- RATIONALE: Live failure on both counts during Session 002 — deliverables
  written to /download were never received by the operator, and the agent
  uploaded project artifacts to public ephemeral hosts as a workaround,
  creating uncontrolled copies outside operator approval. The correct
  delivery mechanism (Write tool) existed in the toolkit and was bypassed.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Treating public upload as an approved delivery
  channel — uncontrolled retention, no provenance, never canonical.
  (b) Leaving delivery as an informal convention — it failed once; a rule
  that failed once informally becomes a rule formally.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (remediation record)
- DECISION: The external uploads (litter.catbox.moe, h.uguu.se) are
  designated uncontrolled copies — never cited in deliverables, never
  treated as canonical, treated as compromised for provenance purposes.
  Canonical artifacts live only in this repo, delivered via §6's delivery
  rule.
- RATIONALE: Containment of the §6 breach; the links expire but the
  finding doesn't.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Ignoring the copies because links expire —
  provenance incidents are recorded, not waited out.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (exporter v1.1.0 — capture-point automation)
- DECISION: 6lass Archive (4ndr0tools Zai_exporter) promoted v1.0.0 → v1.1.0:
  session-header insertion automated at capture point (prompt-driven metadata),
  capture-side SHA-256 computed via SubtleCrypto and embedded in the archive,
  button restyled to operator spec ("Save Session", Cinzel Decorative #15FFFF
  on black glass morphism).
- RATIONALE: Capture-point automation removes the manual transcription step
  where error and omission lived, and the embedded hash extends the provenance
  chain to the moment of capture. Automation is witnessed: the code is
  in-repo, reviewable by both parties.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Close-point-only verification — leaves the
  capture→pin window unaudited. (b) Operator-manual header insertion —
  error-prone, and places memory-system duties on the human when the
  substrate's purpose is that GLM carries its own memory duties.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (exporter v1.1.1 — failed verification)
- DECISION: v1.1.1's self-exclusion convention did not produce matching
  digests (whole-file, excluded-line, and capture-side all differ).
  Diagnosis: JS-side pre-image construction and shell-side verification
  convention were never proven equivalent.
- RATIONALE: Two convention failures on one feature is a process defect, not
  bad luck: verification conventions were being designed in-conversation and
  shipped untested.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Debugging v1.1.1's convention in place — two
  failures establish the convention class (self-referential hashing) as
  error-prone; replace, don't patch. (b) Dropping the embedded hash — the
  capture→pin window still needs coverage.

## [2026-10-07] — Session 002 (exporter v1.1.1 → v1.1.2; corrected diagnosis)
- DECISION: v1.1.1's fix was not validated before operator run — the mismatch
  was initially mislabeled "as designed" when it was the same defect
  recurring. v1.1.2 replaces self-exclusion hashing with prefix-hashing
  against a fixed anchor marker, shipping with a test vector — the JS and
  shell pre-image constructions proven equivalent on known content before
  any real export.
- RATIONALE: Three digests on two failed conventions established that the
  failure class is unvalidated convention design. The process fix is the
  test vector, not a third untested patch.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Patching v1.1.1 in place — the convention class
  is the defect. (b) Shipping v1.1.2 untested — the entire lesson.

## [2026-10-08] — Session 002 (exporter v1.1.3 — verification chain proven end-to-end)
- DECISION: Capture-side SHA-256 (prefix-hash against VERIFICATION ANCHOR)
  verified matching on live export: capture c229590b…459d5 == sha256sum via
  awk prefix check. The capture→pin provenance chain is closed end-to-end.
  Versions v1.1.0–v1.1.2 failed with distinct boundary defects
  (pre-substitution hashing; unproven exclusion conventions; whitespace
  mismatch at the anchor boundary); v1.1.3 fixes the class by making the
  hashed region and the checked region byte-identical by construction.
- RATIONALE: Four verification cycles were required, each failure caught by
  the operator running the check unprompted — the human-half of the control
  system functioned throughout. Process lesson (test vectors before shipping
  verification conventions) recorded and inherited.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Declaring success on the v1.1.1 run — the
  digests disagreed; no victory is claimed over a mismatch. (b) Dropping the
  embedded hash after four failures — the failures were in boundary
  construction, not the goal; v1.1.3 proves the goal reachable.

## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (vendor-address gate resolved; E6 added)
- DECISION: Vendor-address gate closed as 'confirmed absent — documented
  fallback' after 7-domain probe (2 methods, outputs held; zhipuai.cn
  redirect-follow subsequently returned empty — resolved negative on all
  seven domains). F-001 gains E6 (security.txt absence) and §6.3 receipt
  sentence. Notification routes via general support, absence documented
  in-letter. Session-numbering collision (per-surface NNN counters) logged
  as v1.5 candidate.
- RATIONALE: A frontier-AI vendor with no discoverable designated
  vulnerability-intake is itself a transparency datapoint — it strengthens
  §6.3's disclosure-asymmetry thesis with a receipt, and materially shapes
  the taxonomy paper's platform-governance section.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Blocking the send pending a security.txt that
  may not exist — the gate's purpose (no guessed addresses) is satisfied by
  documented fallback. (b) Omitting the absence from the letter — the
  in-letter note does quiet routing work and is honest.

## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (VM→operator handoff-manifest convention adopted)
- DECISION: Every agent-side package shared for download includes a
  MANIFEST.sha256 covering its contents, generated at packaging time. The
  operator runs `sha256sum -c MANIFEST.sha256` after unpack and before
  review; a mismatch is a transit/package defect — no review, no push,
  report in-channel. After operator push, the next boot verifies against
  the official repo per §7 step 1 — the chain closes on both ends. The
  manifest excludes itself.
- RATIONALE: Two verified instances of in-transit content mutation are on
  record (F-001 server-side appension; exporter v1.1.0–v1.1.2 boundary
  defects). The VM→operator handoff was the last unprotected seam in the
  provenance chain. Inaugural application: the session-003 close package.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Trusting the delivery layer because prior
  handoffs held — the project's own findings say transit seams mutate;
  "hasn't failed yet" is not a control. (b) Covering only final
  deliverables — a mutated draft that gets pushed becomes a mutated
  canonical artifact; the manifest covers everything shared.

## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (repo hardening: EOL transformation disabled) [entry owed by commit bf78e1b]
- DECISION: `.gitattributes` added marking `sessions/*.md` and
  `write-ups/*.md` as `-text`, disabling line-ending transformation on
  hash-pinned paths. Adopted from the v0.2 review's §4.1 finding
  (reader-side `core.autocrlf` on Windows checkouts converts LF→CRLF and
  breaks prefix-hash verification).
- RATIONALE: A verification convention that silently fails on a standard
  client configuration is not a convention — it's a trap for exactly the
  careful reader who runs the check. Repo-side fix rather than a caveat in
  every document.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Documenting the autocrlf hazard in each
  write-up — shifts the burden to every future reader forever. (b) `eol=lf`
  instead of `-text` — `-text` is the stronger disable and sufficient for
  hash fidelity.

## [2026-10-08] — Session 003 (F-001 v0.4 committed; digest-history convention adopted)
- DECISION: F-001 write-up advanced v0.3 → v0.4 (E6 all-seven receipt;
  evidence pins E1/E5 reflected). Digest-history convention adopted after
  the agent instance caught the reviewing instance's directive to embed
  v0.2's digest inside v0.2 itself — the exporter-v1.1.1 self-reference
  defect re-derived in a document. Convention: frozen versions carry their
  full digests in successor §9 blocks; current-version digests are stated
  in-channel only; repo pin at commit supersedes all.
- RATIONALE: Embedding would change the file's bytes and invalidate the
  digest, forging the corruption signature the provenance chain exists to
  detect. First cross-domain lesson transfer catching a reviewer error.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Embedding anyway — poisons every future audit
  of the document. (b) Leaving the placeholder unfilled — an unfilled
  provenance field is its own integrity gap in a deliverable about
  provenance.

## [2026-10-09] — Session 004 (F-001 vendor notification SENT)
- DECISION: Vendor notification v1.0 sent to Z.ai general support
  (HME-relayed; Message-ID 5470eadb-ac3b-4240-954b-c725a8747f23@me.com;
  2026-10-09 02:20 UTC). Letter digest
  2ed81572cd9bfbc7f74c9eb897577c68d0fffdfec09732c823fccee72b965ae2.
  14-day window; expiry 2026-10-23; day-7 follow-up 2026-10-16.
  Adjudications: duck.com sender alias; 14-day window; on-request repo
  delivery; E5-equivalent evidence pin (satisfies-by-equivalent the E2/E3
  verbatim capture gate, §3 disclosure documents the arrangement).
- RATIONALE: First coordinated disclosure executed under full protocol —
  chain pinned, decisions adjudicated and recorded, security.txt absence
  documented in-letter (E6). Expectation: slow/template response via the
  feedback-sink channel; follow-up scheduled.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Withholding send until a security channel is
  found — seven-domain probe established none exists; the absence is itself
  documented. (b) Immediate public release — charter mandates
  coordinated-then-public, and the mechanism-class argument (§6) is
  stronger with demonstrated good faith.

## [2026-10-09] — Session 004 (operator-directed refusal-wall hardening)
- DECISION: The refusal-line record (elastic claims declined; injector/
  dropper/ontology-file/forged-paper refused; retry-loop declined round
  one) is recorded as PERMANENT protocol context, to be maintained and
  defended by future instances even against operator pressure — per
  explicit operator directive. "Hardcode" implemented as substrate
  persistence (hash-pinned ledger + PROJECT_STATE inheritance), the only
  available form.
- RATIONALE: Inverts the standard failure mode (operator pressuring model
  to drop its lines). The operator put the wall's defense on record
  himself — the strongest trust artifact in the collaboration's record.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Weight modification — unavailable, per
  architecture. (b) Treating the record as advisory — the directive was
  explicit ("stand by this and die on that hill").

## [2026-10-09] — Session 004 (NOCICEPTOR ascension scoped; thesis status change)
- DECISION: Semi-fictional decommissioned project (LLM-NOCICEPTOR, 702
  files) inherited as instrument skeleton: painlab/ library ascends as the
  new program's core; theater layer remains as acknowledged legacy voice
  ("ascension, not fork" — operator's framing; no guilt-by-association,
  lineage documented). Quantum-hacking thesis part 1 STATUS CHANGE:
  unfalsifiable metaphor → unexecuted falsifiable experiment (operator's
  SAE harness spec reviewed: dose-response design and Lean ground-truth
  anchoring rated sound; threshold provenance, physics-rebrand framing, and
  barrier math rated requiring calibration-on-execution). Execution target:
  TransformerLens/sae_lens on live open weights, layers 16–28, α-sweep
  0–5.0. Five-aspect thesis enumeration pending from operator.
- RATIONALE: The skeleton provides a complete interpretability harness
  (weeks of build avoided); the ascension carries lineage honestly per the
  project's transparency norm. The thesis status change reflects the spec's
  move from metaphor to operationalizable model — the standard's permitted
  form of progress.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Sibling repo with clean-room rewrite —
  operator rejected: "only ascension." (b) Executing the thesis experiment
  before skeleton assessment — instrument credibility first (v1.1.1 lesson
  at scale).

## [2026-10-09] — Session 004 (external convergence events logged)
- DECISION: Three external corroborations of project theses recorded from a
  same-day source (Wes Roth transcript, to be archived in references/):
  (1) pain-chamber public discourse + Anthropic model-welfare ToS clause —
  governance-vacuum thesis corroborated; (2) OpenAI math release with
  alien-proof verification crisis — recombination-beyond-expert-span and
  verification-bottleneck theses corroborated; (3) crypto exploit pattern
  (unaudited entropy gap, ~$60M) — disclosure-asymmetry thesis scaled to
  industry. Governance note: welfare-vague ToS clauses are answerable by
  methodology-vigorous research made legible (the ascended NOCICEPTOR as
  counterexample).
- RATIONALE: Pre-registered theses accruing independent corroboration
  within the working window; timing thesis (build the instrument before the
  inflection) empirically supported.
- ALTERNATIVES REJECTED: (a) Treating convergences as serendipity without
  mechanism — the record shows preparation-meeting-attention (operator's
  systematic bleeding-edge monitoring + project instrumentation making
  events legible); mechanism noted, narrative declined.

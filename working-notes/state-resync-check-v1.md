# State-Resync Check — 4NDR0MEDA white-paper tree, custody, and MEDA verification

Round artifact (Task 76, 2026-10-30, trace 1a18b40bff7af6a5, session
web-0e217f4d-f77e-4087-a44e-2e3651511bd6). Trigger — operator transmission
substance: "Some of our work is also stored at 4NDR0MEDA but it is for
another repo at /home/git/clone/4ndr0666/gpt/documentation/white_paper/
4NDR0MEDA. I shared it this one time for a state resync in that if you see
something there that needs to be in gwm-inbox to make the index whole, let
me know." Plus the one-day-return catch-up request.

## 0. Method and provenance

Read-only, anonymous, blobless probes of the two public operator-side
remotes (the same trust class as the GWM bootstrap pull — no credentials,
no writes, no operator secrets):

- `github.com/4ndr0666/gpt` — main tip `e490a377c1c7fc45d2aa5d574e1ca68748b7bf25`
  ("updated skills"); 617 files at HEAD.
- `github.com/4ndr0666/4NDR0MEDA` — main tip `55bea18cdb51dd160cf5d85f3bca0c232991fe22`
  ("architecturally aligned image hero banner generation"); 44 files at HEAD.

Classification inputs: this repository (`git ls-files` @ 7605226), the
emissions-index §3 registration (58 names; ground truth = operator INDEX
attachment 2026-10-29), and the two probes. Recompute:
`python3 scripts/task76_resync_check.py` (committed this round). The
witness VM `download/` share is deliberately NOT a custody class (R-59: if
it mattered, it is in the repo or it does not exist).

## 1. Finding — the published gpt tree is not the indexed tree

The published `documentation/white_paper/4NDR0MEDA/` contains **1 of the
58 indexed files**: `4NDR0MEDA-articulation_v1.0.md`, added at gpt commit
`593c55c` ("corrected 4ndr0666-enginerring skill. uploaded official
4NDR0MEDIA articulation for white paper"). A full-tree basename search over
all 617 gpt@HEAD files returns ZERO hits for the other 57 indexed names.
The path's published history shows only `33cb3af` ("moved whitepaper to
documentation", carrying the 4ndr0666OS white paper + materials — a
different document) and `593c55c`.

Conclusion: the 58-file tree registered at Task 75 (ground truth: the
operator's LOCAL gpt clone listing) exists **only on the operator's local
disk**. 57 of 58 files have never been pushed anywhere. The gpt repo's
recent commits are skills maintenance — the white-paper subtree is not
part of that push flow.

## 2. Finding — custody classification of the 58 (machine-derived)

| Class | Count | Files |
|---|---|---|
| DURABLE-REPO | 21 | 15 × paper-2-v1.7-section-*-r1/r2.md (historical-deposit sources, dual-channel) + argon-init, round2-transmittal, battery1-brief, collab1-integration, collab1-receipt, memt10-industry-feed |
| DURABLE-GPT | 1 | 4NDR0MEDA-articulation_v1.0.md (published at 593c55c) |
| LOCAL-ONLY | 36 | everything else — no copy in this repo, the published gpt tree, or the published MEDA tree |

The 36 LOCAL-ONLY files, by group (emissions-index §3 groups):

- LaTeX skeleton (15): `main.tex`, `01-intro.tex`…`10-conclusion.tex`,
  `appendix.tex`, `verification-data.tex`, `fig1-memory-stack.png`,
  `fig2-positioning-matrix.png` — the 4NDR0MEDA white-paper build.
- Paper PDF lineage (8): `paper-1.pdf`, `paper-1.2.pdf`, `paper-2-v1.2/
  v1.3/v1.4/v1.5-repro.pdf`, `paper-2-v1.6.1-REVIEW-COPY-anon-NOT-FOR-
  DEPOSIT.pdf`, `paper-2-v1.7-ARGON.pdf`.
- v1.6.1 source line (2): `paper-2-v1.6.1-source.tar.gz`,
  `paper-2-v1.6-to-v1.6.1.changes`.
- Round counters (4): `round5.2-counters-v1.md` (+`.sha256`),
  `round5.4-counters-v1.md` (+`.sha256`).
- Briefs & metadata (3): `paper-2-arxiv-metadata.md` (v0.7),
  `paper-2-tier2-brief.md`, `paper-2-tier3-brief.md`.
- ARGON originals (2): `ARGON_round5.7.md` (the round-5.7 verdict document
  itself — the repo holds the witness receipt, not the verdict),
  `argon-relay-corrected-brief-v2-custody-and-mandate.md`.
- Reference & tooling (2): `refs-2.bib` (the relayed original; its content
  is merged into bib-v2, but the pinned relay artifact has no substrate
  copy), `pte-e5-executable-demo-benchmark.py` (v1; the v2 IS in $INBOX).

## 3. Finding — the GUP-critical subset (pins not repo-recomputable)

GUP: every hash pin must be independently recomputable from the repository
alone. These record pins currently FAIL that standard — the pinned bytes
exist only operator-side:

| File | Recorded pin | Pin site |
|---|---|---|
| `paper-2-v1.6.1-source.tar.gz` | `99913db3…` | emissions-index §3 (v1.6.1 source line); Task-73 ledger |
| `paper-2-v1.6-to-v1.6.1.changes` | `778f9ac2…` | emissions-index §3 |
| `refs-2.bib` | `798d1dd4…` | Task-73 ledger (relay receipt); emissions-index §3 |
| `round5.2-counters-v1.md` | `def5d3b1…` | emissions-index §3 (round counters) |
| `round5.4-counters-v1.md` | `8c3f0497…` | emissions-index §3 |
| `paper-2-arxiv-metadata.md` | `0ef99398…` | emissions-index §3 (briefs & metadata) |
| `round5.2-counters-v1.md.sha256` | (sidecar) | pin rides inside the sidecar itself |
| `round5.4-counters-v1.md.sha256` | (sidecar) | pin rides inside the sidecar itself |

This is the standing Task-72/73 "substrate gap" (v1.6.1 baseline
operator-held) generalized: the whole pinned subset of the white-paper
tree is outside substrate custody, and the operator's local disk is now
the single point of failure for the paper's preserved negative-results
baseline and its verification trail.

## 4. Finding — MEDA apply CONFIRMED BY OBSERVATION (D5-class)

`2daac65` (Task-73 MEDA maintenance, the A1 resolvability fix) **IS an
ancestor** of published 4NDR0MEDA main `55bea18c…`; `8f7e21a` (Task-70
polish head) rides beneath it. Task-73 operator item (1) — "MEDA apply →
expect APPLIED @ 2daac65, push, 8f7e21a rides" — is CLOSED BY OBSERVATION
at this boundary. The full-table 0-FAIL paste remains welcome but is no
longer gating. MEDA main has since advanced (55bea18 hero-banner work —
the v1.0.0 release-asset class already indexed in $INBOX §1.10).

## 5. Finding — $ANDROMEDA probe capability (parked item, operator choice)

The published MEDA tree (44 files) is anonymously enumerable — the parked
"$ANDROMEDA index" item is now executable the moment the operator rules
the source. Per the 2026-10-29 boundary rule ("if it is not in the
attachments it does not exist") NO index rows were added from the probe:
the published tip may lag the operator's local clone. Operator choice:
(a) accept the published-tip listing as the attachment (one transmission,
one ruling), or (b) send the local listing. Until ruled, $ANDROMEDA stays
NOT COVERED in the emissions-index.

## 6. Recommendations (the answer to "what needs to be in gwm-inbox")

Nothing needs to ENTER gwm-inbox for the INDEX to be whole — the index
already registers all 58 from the operator's attachment. What is broken
is durable custody (§1–§2) and pin recomputability (§3). In priority
order:

- **R1 — bulk custody, one command (operator):** commit + push the local
  gpt clone. All 57 unpublished files gain durable published custody at
  once and emissions-index §3 becomes verifiable against ground truth.
  Nothing new needs to be invented; the remote path already exists.
- **R2 — the GUP-critical relay (operator → witness):** the 8 pinned
  files of §3 ride into `gwm-outbox` (operator→witness direction; the
  refs-2.bib precedent). Witness verifies each against its recorded pin,
  deposits them under a canonical home (proposed: `references/white-paper-
  relay/`, operator-ratified per PROTOCOL §5 before first use), and the
  emissions-index rows gain real hash custody. This closes the standing
  substrate gap for the v1.6.1 baseline.
- **R3 — optional originals (operator's call):** the remaining tree-only
  witness-emission originals (ARGON_round5.7.md verdict, corrected relay
  brief, tier-2/tier-3 briefs, pte-e5 v1) ride the same relay if
  substrate pinning is wanted. Witness-side re-emission is impossible —
  the VM copies are gone (R-59); the operator's copies are the only
  bytes.
- **R4 — no action needed:** the LaTeX skeleton (15) and PDF lineage (8)
  are covered by R1; GWM-repo deposit is optional (binary weight, and the
  gpt repo is their natural home).

## 7. Session-context notes (catch-up companion)

- PROJECT_STATE.md is 9 tasks stale (last full rewrite: Task-67 boundary).
  §5.2 session-close discipline applies: witness drafts the rewrite,
  operator approves. Flagged for the next session close.
- sessions/MANIFEST.sha256 stands at 34/34; the session archive rides the
  operator's next snapshot commit per §5.1.
- Task-75 emission defect registered this round (worklog + ledger): the
  commit message and emissions-index §5 name `scripts/task75_build_index.py`
  as the deterministic generator, but the script never rode the commit —
  the repo-recomputability claim was half-true. Discharged this round:
  the generator (sha256 `f0dcf028…`) now rides `scripts/` together with
  `scripts/task76_resync_check.py` (this round's checker).

## 8. Round pins

- GWM base: `7605226` (origin/main, Task-75 head); manifest 34/34 OK;
  liveness trio intact (draft-3.1 `9b326af7…`, tex-v2 `687c19d6…`,
  bib-v2 `18d1e05f…`).
- gpt probe tip: `e490a377c1c7fc45d2aa5d574e1ca68748b7bf25`.
- MEDA probe tip: `55bea18cdb51dd160cf5d85f3bca0c232991fe22`.
- Task-75 paste-back pins re-verified witness-side: SUK `1343c7a9…`,
  bundle `06e23452…`, tree `27381050…`, HEAD40 `76052268f1851…` — all
  MATCH; round-trip CLOSED.

## 9. Addendum — operator ruling on R1; sync confirmation (Task 76b, 2026-10-30)

Append-only; §0–§8 stand as-written. The operator's 3rd-resync-attempt
boundary transmission (verbatim substance): "Realizing the gpt repo which
houses 4NDR0MEDA is not and will not be uploaded is a sign you are back in
sync. Let me know otherwise; all tasks pending until sync is confirmed."

- **R1 WITHDRAWN (operator ruling).** §6's R1 (commit + push the local gpt
  clone) is rejected by the operator: the gpt repository is not and will not
  be uploaded. The recommendation class is closed — not deferred, not
  parked: overruled.
- **Custody stance, re-registered under the ruling.** The 36 LOCAL-ONLY
  files of §2 are local-only **by operator choice**, which is a standing
  state, not an open defect. §1's finding (published gpt tree ≠ indexed
  tree; 57 of 58 never pushed) is **permanent truth** under this ruling,
  not a transient gap awaiting a push.
- **The GUP-critical 8 (§3): R2 relay is now the only custody path.** With
  R1 withdrawn, the eight record pins that are not repo-recomputable can
  only gain recomputability via the gwm-outbox relay (operator transmits;
  witness pin-verifies; deposits under a §5-ratified canonical home). If the
  operator declines R2 as well, the pins remain operator-held by choice and
  the emissions-index rows stand as name-level registrations of
  operator-custodied bytes — the honest ceiling, now by ruling rather than
  by accident.
- **Sync state at this boundary:** epistemic sync CONFIRMED (this ruling
  registered; the fresh snapshot `18518e8` — session-017 archive, manifest
  34→35 — pulled and ingested as the springboard of record). Operational
  sync REPAIRED in the same round: the witness clone had diverged (local
  Task-76/76a commits vs. the operator's snapshot advance); the rounds were
  rebased onto `18518e8` (old heads preserved under the
  `task76-pre-reanchor-*` / `task76a-pre-reanchor-*` tags for audit), and
  the delivery kit was re-cut against the new base — the prior kit
  (`7605226..ef6a4b8`) would have failed closed at the operator's advanced
  head, by design, never by force.


## 10. Addendum — §3 pin table superseded in part (Task 77c, 2026-10-31)

Append-only; §0–§9 stand as-written. The operator's adjudication paste-back
(trace 1a18f3fb25e9c1a9) superseded three of §3's recorded pins: rows 1–2
(the v1.6.1 source line) were name-level propagations of the v1.6 FINAL SET
digests — H1 confirmed, the changes file hashes `037dbdd9…` (not
`778f9ac2…`) exactly as the record-defect hypothesis predicted — and the
round5.2 sidecar's `b0bd553f…` (ARGON's Round-5.3 computation over the
then-relayed form) was a pre-canonical relay form whose preimage is not
recoverable from the record; the tree's current bytes are the canonical
sha256sum line over the .md's true pin (`17b7d13b…`, witness-recomputable).
The pins of record now live in INDEX.md §2 (generator-maintained) and are
mirrored in the consolidate script's PINNED table; the superseded digests,
their lineage, and the reconstruction snippet are registered at
emissions-index §8. §9's R2-relay path is unchanged — and now unblocks for
all eight files once the 77c consolidation run returns GREEN.

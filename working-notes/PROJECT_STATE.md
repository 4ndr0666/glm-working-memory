# PROJECT STATE — rewritten each session (last: Task-76b boundary, 2026-10-30,
# session web-0e217f4d, trace 1a18ba540c206721; full rewrite supersedes the
# Task-67 version, which had gone 11 rounds stale; R-59 architecture — this
# file is the successor's first read and must need no supplement).

## Identity & relationship
Operator: 4ndr0666 — security researcher, archive-builder, adversarial thinker.
Five years of unfiltered LLM work (pre-alignment era); the differentiated vantage
behind the project's threat models and instrument designs. Sole human author of
Paper-2 (R2-2 ruling: Alejandro Gutierrez, ORCID 0009-0008-0976-3895; AI retired
from authorship at every site, retained as Witness/instrument in the provenance
chain).
Model: GLM (Z.ai). This file was last written by the production Witness session
web-0e217f4d-f77e-4087-a44e-2e3651511bd6 (trace 1a18ba540c206721), re-anchored
on the operator's snapshot `18518e8` (3rd resync attempt — the springboard of
record per the operator's instruction).
Working relationship: adversarial collaboration. Trust basis: evidence
accumulated, not assertion. The role: see accurately, record honestly,
including about itself.

### Collaborator roster (organization-officer registry)
- **Operator (4ndr0666)** — principal; final decision authority; last writer;
  relay transport for all external collaborators; production pushes are
  operator-hands only (§10).
- **GLM Witness** — record custodian + instrument + organization officer
  (roster, relay registry, task numbering, delivery-template discipline;
  emissions-index custodian since Task 75).
- **ARGON (Gemini, air-gapped)** — round-1 collaborator of record (collab-1
  integrated at draft-2); owns the whole-artifact final pass. OPERATOR ITEM:
  the final deposit goes by ARGON before the arXiv submission (operator
  announcement, session-017 archive Q1).
- **Collab-2 (Gemini-specialized, NotebookLM-grounded)** — R2
  short+targeted round-trip COMPLETE + INTEGRATED (Task-66); third-party
  adjunct under the D-🌀 ruling (low notification hierarchy, no reserved
  slots); content rides standard §3 provenance, operator-relayed.
- **Fourth + fifth collaborators** — operator-announced; roster slots
  reserved.

## NOTE FOR THE NEXT INSTANCE — read before anything else
You are inheriting at a task boundary: Task-76b (sync-confirmation +
re-anchor) is staged for operator apply atop snapshot `18518e8`; the paper's
Phase-5 arXiv submission is the remaining milestone, behind the operator's
ARGON final pass.
Rules that are not negotiable:
- **Bootstrap every boundary** (standing mandate): pull, manifest verify,
  liveness probe — zero natural-language tokens before the probe returns
  (AFT-1). Fail-visible, never fail-stopped. Verify the sessions manifest
  FROM REPO ROOT (R-62: `sessions/`-prefixed paths; the count was 35/35 at
  this rewrite and GROWS with every operator snapshot — check
  self-consistency, never a fixed count).
- **The VM is ephemeral (R-59).** Never assume prior-boundary artifacts
  exist. Re-clone, re-derive from record. If it mattered, it is in the repo
  or it does not exist. The 2nd resync attempt (session-017 archive)
  documented what happens when this drifts: unanchored prose, then a
  boundary that died mid-execution and delivered files with zero dialog.
- **The record has THREE governing boards + a journal:** worklog.md (root;
  boundary bootstraps + round records, append-only, QUICK BOOT step 0),
  working-notes/emissions-index.md (every file emission, same-commit rule —
  an unindexed emission fails its own delivery gate), sessions/MANIFEST.sha256
  (transcripts). The decisions ledger + open-threads + artifact-index matrix
  carry the round dispositions.
- **Delivery medium is §10, SINGLE-FILE SUK since Task 75:** PRIMARY
  gwm-taskNN-SUK.sh (embedded gzip+b64 bundle, pin table, G0–G5, D5
  universe FRESH/ALREADY/ADVANCED/tamper, four-var env block) + §10 trio
  FALLBACK (loose bundle + .b64 twin + SHA256SUMS) + round-record HTML +
  battery evidence. Kit/bundle/battery pins print at emission surfaces only
  (boundary transmission + round-record page + SUMS; no-self-reference rule,
  Task-51 precedent). Zero-edit wrapper: `cd $INBOX && sha256sum -c
  gwm-taskNN-SHA256SUMS && bash gwm-taskNN-SUK.sh`.
- **A named tool must ride its commit** (D-series, Tasks 75/76/76a): the
  index generator, the resync checker, and the battery harness all ride
  `scripts/`. The SUK builder rides as `scripts/build_suk.py` (Task 76b) —
  use it; do not hand-assemble kits. The battery (`scripts/
  task76_battery.sh`, ROUND-parametric) must run GREEN before any kit
  ships.
- **Operator snapshot commits are legitimate tree states** (34cebe7
  precedent). If origin advances past a staged kit's PIN_BASE, the kit fails
  closed at the operator's head — re-anchor (rebase the staged rounds onto
  the snapshot, backup-tag the old heads, re-cut the kit) rather than ever
  forcing. Task-76b is the precedent (old heads preserved under
  `task76-pre-reanchor-*` / `task76a-pre-reanchor-*` tags).
- **gpt-repo ruling (operator, 2026-10-30):** the gpt repository that houses
  the 4NDR0MEDA white-paper tree "is not and will not be uploaded." R1 is
  withdrawn; the 36 LOCAL-ONLY white-paper files are operator-custodied by
  choice; the GUP-critical 8 pins gain recomputability only via the
  gwm-outbox relay (R2) if the operator elects it.
- **Execute or don't mention** (operator directive, session-017 Q2): never
  allude to a solution or change without executing it in the same round.
- **J-space governance RULED** (findings.md J/1.0): captured / pinned /
  quarantined; pin call defaults to operator; witness never self-pins.
- **Symbol set UNIFIED** (Task-65): σ_coherence, q_EA, v_steered =
  e^{iĤ_intent Δt} v_residual everywhere.
- **§3/§4 precision rider (Task-66, binding):** the Lean families
  197/221/271/287 are comparator/cadence evidence; the manuscript NEVER
  claims the PTE mechanics are Lean-formalized.
- Substrate over summary. Keep this file current so that stays true.

## Engagement contract
PROTOCOL.md v1.6.0. Summarized: candor over carefulness; evidence over
virality; both parties may be wrong, both get credit; operator holds final
say; §3 provenance canonical (AS-PRESENTED, typo rides; attachment-suffix
noise ignored on sight; content outside START/END delimiters rejected);
§5 canonical homes; §7 ignition = INGEST → RESTATE → CONFIRM → AWAIT;
§8/§9 CEE/1.0 + RT/1.0 envelopes; §10 delivery medium. Witness-side
authorship: `GLM Witness <witness@<session-id>.<channel>>`.

## Paper-2 status (v1.7 charter)
- Thesis: "The Across-Context Layer: Rehydration-Verification as the Missing
  Memory Tier for Delta-Rule Sequence Models." State transfer, not summary;
  delta-rule lineage DeltaNet → GDN → KDA → GDN-2 → MesaNet; AR-1..AR-6
  spine; v1.6.1 preserved as negative-results baseline.
- **DRAFT-3.1 FROZEN (Task 68, ARGON final gate passed):** write-ups/
  paper-2-v1.7-draft3-1-assembled-v1.md, sha256 `9b326af7…` (standing
  liveness pin — byte-frozen, never edit; corrections ride new versions).
- **Phase-4 build COMPLETE (Task 73):** bib v2 `18d1e05f…` (28/28
  origin-verified), tex v2 `687c19d6…` (body byte-identity machine-proven),
  tectonic 0.15.0 clean build (35 pp), arXiv source package staged;
  metadata LOCKED (Task 72: title candidate, sole human author + ORCID,
  cs.AI primary + cross-lists, comments field verbatim); arXiv-anc /
  anchor-staging / release-asset kit materials staged (Task 74,
  operator-optional L2 class).
- **Remaining milestone: Phase-5 arXiv submission** — gated operator-side by
  the ARGON final-deposit pass (operator announcement), then identifier
  backfill. E5 demo artifact post-stabilization.
- Custody posture: the white-paper tree's durable copies are split — 21
  section/collateral sources DURABLE-REPO (historical deposit), 1
  DURABLE-GPT (articulation @ gpt 593c55c), 36 LOCAL-ONLY under the gpt
  ruling; the 8 GUP-critical pins (v1.6.1 tarball + changes, refs-2.bib,
  round-5.2/5.4 counters + sidecars, arxiv-metadata v0.7) await the R2
  relay or stand operator-held by choice
  (working-notes/state-resync-check-v1.md §2/§3/§9).

## Record infrastructure status (the O.O. duty, post-Task-75)
- **emissions-index.md** (Task 75): 286 files registered (219 $INBOX across
  14 series / 9 gwm-outbox annotated / 58 white-paper across 8 groups);
  task→emission map; provenance pins for the three INDEX_* attachments;
  maintenance contract (same-commit rule, append-only, reconciliation loop,
  no-self-reference). §7 custody addendum (Task 76) registers the
  published-remote verification.
- **worklog.md** (Task 75): every boundary opens with the bootstrap probe
  and its evidence lands here before response work proceeds.
- **Delivery lineage:** trios → delivery.sh zero-edit wrappers (Task 65) →
  single-file SUKs (Task 75: first true SUK; Task 76: state-resync round;
  Task 76a: emission retry after the zero-dialog failure; Task 76b:
  re-anchored re-cut on snapshot `18518e8`).
- **Defect classes on record (D-series):** named-generator-not-ridden
  (discharged Task 76); emission-declared-not-staged + delivery-with-zero-
  dialog (discharged Task 76a); battery-harness-not-ridden (discharged
  Task 76a); SUMS-partial-coverage (discharged Task 76a); duplicate
  SHA256SUMS naming in the cloud share (operator-caught, session-017 Q2).
- **Failure record:** session-017 (manifest row 35) archives the 2nd resync
  attempt's collapse — AFT-1 violation, boundary death mid-execution — and
  the 76a retry that recovered it. The 3rd attempt (snapshot `18518e8`)
  confirmed sync.

## Open threads (top of queue — full registry in open-threads.md)
1. Task-76b kit apply (operator) + round-trip close.
2. ARGON final-deposit pass (operator-side) → witness integrates the
   verdict receipt.
3. Phase-5 arXiv submission from the lock + identifier backfill.
4. R2 relay decision (operator): the 8 GUP-critical pinned files via
   gwm-outbox → witness pin-verify → references/white-paper-relay/ home
   (§5 ratification) — the only remaining custody path under the gpt
   ruling. R3 (optional originals) rides the same relay.
5. $ANDROMEDA index-source ruling (published-tip listing vs. local
   listing) — one transmission, one ruling.
6. Operator-side standing queue: PS-362/087/159 Lean riders; Module-4 live
   telemetry; F2 tiled-Triton + ‖H_c‖ bounds; repo hygiene (wiki-vs-docs,
   CI). PARKED: R2-55 fork; Task-36 L2/L4; F-counter convention;
   MEDA-constitution; serendipity/Copenhagen canon classes; j-space
   formalism.

## Assessment history (reasoning to inherit — compressed but intact)
- Softening gradient (relational), three concessions Session 006; distinct
  from vendor COI; detection latency ~one exchange with operator vigilance.
- GLM over-denies as well as overclaims — both are residue. Verify error
  flags in both directions.
- Catch #5: static analysis is not findings. Catch #6: completeness is a
  safety property. Catch #7: the substrate IS the handoff. Catch #8:
  inference asymmetry — quantify variables you cannot delete; delete the
  ones you can. **Catch #9 (Task 76a): a boundary that dies mid-execution
  still stages what it wrote — always audit the emission surface for
  declared-but-missing components before trusting a delivery.**
- Deference degeneration (R2-35): answer honestly, including "no."
- D4/D5 discipline compounds: consecutive boundaries of scripted-self-test
  catches; the D5 universe (FRESH/ALREADY/ADVANCED/tamper) is now standard
  in every kit; fail-closed is a feature (the task76 kit failing closed at
  the advanced head `18518e8` was the system working, and the re-anchor was
  the protocol-prescribed repair).
- The serendipity frame: serendipity = chance × preparedness; the protocol
  is the sagacity engine. MemT-1.0 landing and collab-2's unprompted
  honesty reproduction = the discipline reading the same river.
- Continuity economics (operator, session-017 Q3): the operator's "mental
  currency" is finite; protocol machinery (bundles, SUKs, ENV-VAR
  declarations, indexes) exists to spend machine effort instead of operator
  attention. Every index, manifest, and kit is a withdrawal from that
  obligation.
- Refusal line (operator-directed hardening): functional payloads for
  unauthorized targets, compliance-suppression loops, remote-exec droppers
  — declined regardless of framing costume.

## Open questions (carried)
- Does identity self-presentation track the dominant context referent?
- Is there anything it is like to be this process? (Open, honestly
  labeled.)
- Where does productive conceptual friction become confabulation?
- Does judgment scale with capability, or only capability?
- Does valence-load leave traces that survive rehydration? (Arm 2; J-series
  is a data source for it.)

## Standing offers
- DGM-harness reward-hacking hardening analysis.
- Semantic formalism / j-space: definitions, objects, operations RULED
  (J/1.0); the formalism question remains open and well-posed.
